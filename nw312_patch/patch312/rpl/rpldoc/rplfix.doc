RPLFIX is used to allow workstations to remote program load (RPL) properly
with MS DOS 5.x and above.  This utility must be run after the boot image file
(usually NET$DOS.SYS) has been created using the DOSGEN utility.  RPLFIX will
directly modify the boot image file; the boot image file's size and last
modified date will be different after RPLFIX has been run.  RPLFIX only needs
to be run against the boot image file once.  Attempts to run RPLFIX against an
already modified boot image file are detected by the utility, and no further
modifications will be made to the boot image file.

Follow the instructions for DOSGEN (setting up remote reset workstations)
in the Novell reference manuals.  For NetWare v2.x, this information can be
found in Chapter 9 of the "Supervisor Guide", or Chapter 2 of the "Using the
Network" manual.  For NetWare v3.x, this information is found in Appendix D
of the Installation manual.  After performing all steps as outlined in the
appropriate manual to create the boot image file, run RPLFIX.COM.

The remote workstation will likely hang during the reset process if you are
resetting using DOS 5.x or above and the boot image file has not been modified
by RPLFIX.

RPLFIX can be found on the WSGEN diskette, or in the WSGEN subdirectory if you
are installing using a network drive.  After you have located RPLFIX.COM, map
a drive to the LOGIN subdirectory on the file server you wish to remote reset
from.  The DOSGEN procedure instructed you to create a boot image file in that
subdirectory (usually named NET$DOS.SYS). If the drive you mapped to SYS:LOGIN
was drive F, then you would enter the following:

       RPLFIX F:NET$DOS.SYS <ENTER>

RPLFIX only needs to be run if the version of DOS loaded on the floppy disk
used with DOSGEN is 5.x or greater.  Earlier versions of DOS do not require
that this utility be run.

NOTE:  If you renamed your boot image file, then you must use the new filename
      with RPLFIX:

           RPLFIX [d:]<boot image file> <ENTER>

where  [d:] is the drive letter where the image file is located, and <boot
	image file> is the name of the file created with the DOSGEN utility.



***********************************************************************
When to use RPLFIX.COM.
***********************************************************************

This is to clarify when and how to use rplfix.com.  
The name "rplfix.com" is misleading -- it is not for IBM RPL proms, nor
is it for Novell Enhanced Remote Boot (RPL-STYLE) proms.

When using DOS v5.0 or higher with Novell IPX Remote Boot proms, 
workstations will hang as command.com is loading.  The way to recognize this
is that the autoexec.bat file will not execute --not even the first line of
the autoexec.  The config.sys files will all load fine, because they load 
before command.com loads.   If no autoexec.bat is present, then the 
workstation will hang just before an A: prompt is presented on the 
workstation screen.   The A: prompt will never appear and the workstation 
will hang.

Solution:  Use rplfix.com only with Novell Remote Boot Proms where the 
boot image (net$dos.sys) has DOS 5.0 or higher.  Do not use rplfix.com 
with IBM RPL proms.  Rplfix awareness is already built-into the following
files:  token.rpl, ether.rpl, pcn2l.rpl, f1eth.rpl, rboot.rpl.  
Do not use etherrpl.nlm or tokenrpl.nlm, etc., that ships 
with NetWare v3.11.

REASON FOR RPLFIX.COM:  Rplfix.com's purpose in life is to enhance 
Novell Boot Prom code while it sits in ram below 640k.  This fix keeps 
DOS 5.0's command.com from loading on top of the boot prom code in ram 
and killing the remote boot process.  This is because DOS 5.0 command.com
is much larger than in previous versions and it over-wrote Novell's
boot prom code when command.com loaded.

If using a Novell Remote Boot Prom, rplfix is needed.  Dosgen the 
net$dos.sys file and run rplfix against net$dos.sys with the following 
syntax:

RPLFIX F:NET$DOS.SYS <enter>


Note:  Rplfix.com and rplodi.com are both included in the NOVELL
RPL KIT.
