INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Before installing the new modules included in this update kit, it is
recommended that you make a backup of all files that will be overwritten.

1- Copy files to appropriate subdirectory (ea. CLIB.NLM to SYS:\SYSTEM\, and
NWSNUT.MSG to SYS:\SYSTEM\NLS\4\).

2- Re-load the updated modules or just restart the server using the console
command "RESTART SERVER".

ISSUE: 

This file contains a new version of CLIB.NLM and CLIBAUX.NLM. Two issues were
addressed in CLIB.NLM and one issue was addressed in CLIBAUX.NLM.

CLIB.NLM Issues:
    
1. The wrong day of the week is returned by applications that use the CTIME API
after February 29, 2000. For example, March 1, 2000 is a Wednesday, but some
backup software products using this API displayed March 1, 2000 as a Tuesday. 
If backups were set for every Tuesday, two backups would occur the week of
February 29, 2000. Backups made after Tuesday, February 29, 2000 would be off
by one day. This problem does not affect any application that uses dates in
numeric format, only those applications using the CTIME API that rely on the
day of the week.

Applications using the API STRFTIME with the %D  parameter return
the wrong date.  If the date is February 01, 2000, it return 02/01/100 instead
of 02/01/00.

Developers:
  These problems are seen with NLMs developed using ANCII C source code, with
the Novell APIs STRFTIME and CTIME.  These problems are seen only with NetWare
versions 3.12 and 3.2, and have not been observed in NetWare versions 4.x or
5.x.


CLIBAUX.NLM Issue:

1. Fixed a 4 byte overwrite of the stat structure in the routines stat() and
fstat(). This can only be seen on a NetWare 3.12 or 3.2 server.
