LAN Driver Statistics        Introduction

                  By comparing information about the LAN drivers installed on 
                  the NetWare server, you can tell which cabling system is  
                  handling the most traffic.  

                  If errors occur frequently on a high-traffic system, you  
                  may want to switch some of the workstations on the busy  
                  system to a new cabling system or to a less busy cabling  
                  system.  

                  For information on viewing LAN driver statistics, see " 
                  Viewing LAN Driver Statistics" in Chapter 6 of Supervising  
                  the Network. 
                  The generic statistics common to most of the current  
                  drivers are listed in the following tables: 

Table B-1, "LAN Driver statistics common to all topologies,"  
Table B-2, "Generic statistics for Ethernet drivers," 
Table B-3, "Generic statistics for RX-Net(tm) drivers," 
Table B-4, "Generic statistics for Token-ring drivers," 
Table B-5, "Generic statistics for baseband pcn2l drivers," 

CUSTOM STATISTICS vary, depending on the LAN driver installed. For statistical
information about third-party drivers, check the documentation that comes with
the driver.  In most cases the programmer put this information in to give added
statistical information that is in most cases only useful to the programmer.  

NOTE: If Card is not listed in the custom statistics section contact
manufacturer/Driver writer of LAN Card in server for custom statistics
documentation.

Statistic Explanation 

          Driver Name                      The driver name and parameters  
                                           that correspond to the  hardware  
                                           settings on the network board. 

          Version                          The current version of the driver.

          Node Address                     The station or node address of the 
                                           network board in the  NetWare  
                                           server. 

          Protocols                        The communication protocols bound  
                                           to the driver with BIND.

          Network Address                  The network number assigned to the 
                                           cabling system the LAN  driver is  
                                           operating on. Appears only if the  
                                           IPX protocol has  been bound to  
                                           the board. 

     Generic Statistics
          Total Packets Sent               The number of packets sent from 
                                           the NetWare server through  this 
                                           LAN driver. (By comparing this 
                                           figure with the figures for  other
                                           LAN drivers, you can see which 
                                           driver is handling the  most 
                                           traffic.)  (Maintained by TSM).

          Total Packets Received           The number of packets received by  
                                           the NetWare server since  it was  
                                           last booted (includes file service 
                                           requests, packets  routed to  
                                           another network, and packets sent  
                                           to other IPX  sockets in the  
                                           NetWare server). (Maintained by TSM).
 
          No ECB Available Count           A counter that increments when a  
                                           device sends a packet to  your  
                                           NetWare server, but no packet  
                                           receive buffer is available.  The  
                                           NetWare server allocates more  
                                           packet receive buffers  after each 
                                           incident until it reaches its  
                                           maximum limit  (configured with a  
                                           SET parameter). If you are using  
                                           an EISA or  microchannel bus  
                                           master board (such as the NE3200), 
                                           you  will probably need to  
                                           increase both the minimum and   
                                           maximum number of packet receive  
                                           buffers. See the SET parameters.

          Send Packet Too Big Count        A counter that increments when the
                                           NetWare server tries to  transmit 
                                           a packet that is too large for the
                                           hardware to handle. (Maintained by 
                                           TSM). 

          Reserved                         This field is reserved for use by
                                           the msm, but should be initialized

          Receive Packet Overflow Count    The HSM (lan driver) may user this
                                           counter to indicate the number of
                                           times the adapter's receive buffers
                                           overflowed causing subsequent
                                           incoming packets to be discarded.
                                           (?? A counter that increments when
                                           the NetWare server receives  a
                                           packet that is too big to store in
                                           a cache buffer. This happens
                                           rarely, unless you are running a 
                                           software program that does  not

          Receive Packet Too Big Count     The TSM increments this counter
                                           whenever a packet is received that
                                           is too large for the provided
                                           receive buffer(s). (Maintained by
                                           TSM).

          Receive Packet Too Small Count   Some TSMs increment this counter if
                                           a packet is received that is too
                                           small for media definitions. 
                                           Currently only the RX-Net TSM
                                           Maintains this counter. 

          Send Packet Miscellaneous        A counter that increments when  
          Errors                           errors occur with send packets.

                                           packets. (Maintained by HSM).

          Send Packet Retry Count          A counter that increments when the
                                           NetWare server tries to  send a 
                                           packet but fails because of a 
                                           hardware error. Based on  the 
                                           number of retries in the retry 
                                           counter, the NetWare server  will 
                                           try to send the packet until it is
                                           sent or the retry setting is  
                                           reached. If you receive a large 
                                           number of these errors, use  LOAD 
                                           LAN driver to increase the maximum
                                           retry count, or  check the cabling
                                           and workstation hardware.

          Checksum Errors                  The HSM may use this counter to
                                           increment when the checksum byte at
                                           the  end of the  packet does not
                                           match the sum of the bytes 
                                           contained in the packet. This
                                           indicates a data error. (Maintained

                                           hardware and the length specified 
                                           by the packet do  not match.

                                           successfully. When the Ethernet
                                           controller detects a collision, it
                                           backs off and then will retry the
                                           transmission.

          Send OK Multiple Collision Count The number of frames involved in
                                           more than one collision but  
                                           transmitted successfully. This
                                           happens when the Ethernet
                                           controller had to back off more
                                           than once due to collisions.  See
                                           also TxAbortExcessCollisions.
      
          Send OK But Deferred             The number of frames whose  
                                           transmission was delayed  because  
                                           of a busy medium. This happens  
                                           when another  station is  
                                           transmitting on the wire when the  
                                           adapter receives  the command to  
                                           transmit a packet.
     
          Send Abort From Late Collision   The number of transmits that had a
                                           collision occur after 512 bits of
                                           the packet had been transmitted. 
                                           This can be caused by faulty 
                                           adapters, faulty network 
                                           equipment, cable lengths not to
                                           specifications, or faulty
                                           termination. 

          Send Abort From Excess           The number of transmits that were  
          Collisions                       aborted because of too  many 
                                           collisions. This usually indicates
                                           that a board in the network is bad
                                           or jabbering.  This condition could
                                           also possibly occur in very heavy
                                           traffic  conditions.

          Send Abort From Carrier Sense    The number of transmits aborted 
                                           because of loss of carrier  sense 
                                           while transmitting without any
                                           collisions occurring. This usually
                                           indicates a bad board in the
                                           network (shorting the cable),
                                           faulty cable, un-terminated cable
                                           or faulty repeater.

          Send Abort From Excessive        The number of transmits aborted  
          Deferral                         because of excessive  deferrals. 
                                           This is usually caused by a faulty
                                           adapter or repeater in the network
                                           that is jabbering on the wire. 
                                           This condition could also possibly
                                           occur in very heavy traffic
                                           conditions.

          Receive Abort From Bad Frame     The number of received frames that 
          Alignment                        were misaligned. This occurs when
                                           the number of octets in the frame
                                           is not correct or it does not pass
                                           the FCS check.  These  bad packets
                                           are usually caused by a faulty
                                           adapter or repeater in the system.
                                           They can also be caused by a
                                           collision.

Statistic Explanation 

          No Response to Free Buffer       A counter that increments each  
          Enquiry                          time there is no response  from  
                                           the receiving node to Free Buffer  
                                           Enquiry.
 
          Network Reconfiguration Count    A counter that increments each  
                                           time a Network  Reconfiguration  
                                           occurs.
 
          Invalid Split Flag in Packet     A counter that increments each  
          Fragment                         time the Split Flag in the  packet 
                                           fragment is not the value  
                                           expected. Packet fragments   
                                           received out of order can cause  
                                           this value to increase. 

           Orphan Packet Fragment Count    A counter that increments each  
                                           time a packet fragment is   
                                           received that is not a part of a  
                                           previously received packet and   
                                           therefore cannot be appended.
 
           Receive Packet Timeout          A counter that increments each  
                                           time a received packet times  out  
                                           while waiting for the rest of the  
                                           packet fragments to arrive.
 
           Free Buffer Enquiry NAK Timeout A counter that increments each  
                                           time a transmit packet times  out  
                                           while waiting for an  
                                           acknowledgment to a Free Buffer   
                                           Enquiry from the receiving node. 

           Total Send Packet Fragments OK  A counter that increments each 
                                           time a packet fragment is sent  
                                           successfully. This number will be
                                           high because packets are made up of
                                           multiple fragments. For example a
                                           4K packet is actually eight 512
                                           byte packet fragments.
 
           Total Receive Packet Fragments  A counter that increments each 
           OK                              time a packet fragment is  
                                           received successfully. This number
                                           will be high because packets are
                                           made up of multiple fragments. For
                                           example a 4K packet is actually
                                           eight 512 byte packet fragments.

Generic statistics for TOKEN-RING drivers (Using TOKENTSM.NLM).
Statistic Explanation 

           AC Error Counter             This counter increments when a ring
                                        station receives a "Standby Monitor
                                        Present" MAC frame with the A/C bits
                                        in the Frame Status field equal to
                                        zero without first receiving an
                                        "Active Monitor Present" MAC frame.

           Abort Delimiter              This counter increments when a ring
                                        station transmits an abort delimiter.
                                        An abort delimiter is transmitted when
                                        a ring station receives a frame in
                                        which the token bit of the access
                                        control field is set to show "Token"
                                        and not "Frame."  A ring station can
                                        also transmit an abort delimiter in an
                                        internal hardware error has occurred.

           Burst Error Counter          This counter increments when a ring
                                        station detects the absence of "five
                                        half-bit times" (a burst-five error). 
                                        Other stations will detect a burst-
                                        four error followed by idles.
 
           Frame Copied Error Counter   This counter increments when a ring
                                        station recognizes (receives or
                                        repeats) a frame addressed to its
                                        specific address and detects that the
                                        FS field A bits are set to 1
                                        indicating a possible line hit or a
                                        duplicate address.

           Frequency Error Counter      This counter is incremented when the
                                        frequency of the incoming signal
                                        differs from the expected frequency by
                                        more than that specified in Section 7
                                        (IEEE Std 802.5-1989).

           Internal Error Counter       This counts the times a ring station
                                        has a recoverable internal error,
                                        which means a ring station is probably
                                        marginal.

           Last Ring Status             This code changes each time the ring
                                        status changes.  Status codes, are
                                        reported by the physical hardware. 
                                        See the IBM Token-Ring Network
                                        Architecture Reference for the Status
                                        Code, Function and Meaning.

           Line Error Counter           This counter increments when a frame
                                        or token is repeated by the ring
                                        station.  A frame is repeated when a
                                        "Frame Check Sequence" error occurs or
                                        a code violation exists between the
                                        starting and ending delimiters of the
                                        frame.

           Lost Frame Counter           This counts instances when a ring
                                        station transmits a frame that does
                                        not return to the station.  The active
                                        monitor sends a new token.

           Token Error Counter          This counter is incremented when a
                                        station acting as the active monitor
                                        recognizes an error condition that
                                        needs a token transmitted. This occurs
                                        when the TVX timer expires.

           Up Stream Node High Dword:   The first 8 digits of the Up Stream
                                        node address of next node up stream on
                                        the ring.

           Up Stream Node Low Dword:    The next 4 digits of the Up Stream
                                        node address of next node up stream on
                                        the ring.

           Last Ring ID                 This contains the value of the local
                                        ring.

           Last Beacon Type             This contains the value of the last
                                        beacon type.

          Send OK Multiple Collision Count The number of frames involved in 
                                           more than one collision but  
                                           subsequently transmitted
                                           successfully. 

          Send OK But Deferred             The number of frames whose  
                                           transmission was delayed  because  
                                           of a busy medium. This happens  
                                           when another  station is  
                                           transmitting on the wire when the  
                                           adapter receives  the command to  
                                           transmit a packet.

          Send Abort From Excess           The number of transmits that were  
          Collisions                       aborted because of too  many  
                                           collisions. This is usually caused 
                                           by a faulty adapter in  the  
                                           system. It can also occur under  
                                           very heavy traffic  conditions.
 
          Send Abort From Carrier Sense    The number of transmits aborted  
                                           because of loss of carrier  sense  
                                           while transmitting any collisions. 
                                           This is usually caused  by a  
                                           faulty adapter in the system,  
                                           faulty cabling, an  unterminated  
                                           cable, or a faulty repeater. 

          Receive Abort From Bad Frame     The number of received frames that 
          Alignment                        were misaligned. These  bad  
                                           packets are usually caused by a  
                                           faulty adapter or repeater  in the 
                                           system. They can also be caused by 
                                           a collision.

          UnderrunErrorCount               This counter increments when the
                                           RAM buffer on the network board is
                                           full; the board cannot accept any
                                           more packets until the RAM buffer
                                           is cleared.

          TransmitTimeoutCount             This counter increments when a
                                           network board interrupts the file
                                           server with the message that the
                                           "send bit" is lost.  This is a
                                           hardware problem caused by faulty
                                           cabling, a bad network board, or a
                                           missing terminator.

          RxPagingErrorCount               This is a count of the errors that
                                           occur when internal buffers on the
                                           card are corrupted.

          ReceiveFIFOOverrunErrorCount     This counter increments when an
                                           incoming packet causes an overflow
                                           because FIFO was not serviced.

          ReceiverMissedPacketCount        This counter increments when a
                                           packet is sent to a network board
                                           that cannot accept the packet
                                           because all its receive buffers are
                                           full.

          GotNothingCount                  This counter increments when the
                                           file server receives an interrupt
                                           from a network board that is not
                                           transmitting or receiving anything. 
                                           This is not serious.

          UnsupportedFramePacketCount      This counter increments when a
                                           packet is received by the lan
                                           driver with a frame type that
                                           hasn't been loaded for the given
                                           card.

          UnsupportedMulticastCount        This counter increments for each
                                           multicast packet received by the
                                           card that is not registered with
                                           the driver.

          BackToBackSendCount              This counter increments each time
                                           the driver can buffer a send packet
                                           onto the network board while the
                                           board is sending a previous buffer. 
                                           Use this counter to track
                                           congestion on the network board. 
                                           See also "EnqueuedSendsCount".

          EnqueuedSendsCount               This counter increments when the
                                           driver is unable to transmit a
                                           packet and must put the packet in a
                                           que until the transmitter is
                                           available.  Use the counter to
                                           track congestion on the network
                                           board.  See also "BackToBack
                                           SendCount".

          In32BitModeCount (NE1000 only)   This counter increments if a
                                           network board is ever found in 32-
                                           bit mode. (Currently, workstations
                                           run in 8-bit mode.) Occasionally,
                                           older ne1000 boards have bad ships
                                           that make the boards go into 32-bit
                                           mode.  If you ever see this counter
                                           incremented, you probably have one
                                           of those older boards on the
                                           network.

          HeartBeatError                   This counter increments when there
                                           is a collision after transmission. 
                                           This function is also known as
                                           heartbeat or SQE (Signal Quality
                                           Error) test.  This counter would
                                           indicate a hardware problem.

          MemoryTimeout                    This counter increments when there
                                           is contention on the bus.  This
                                           counter incrementing is indicative
                                           of a bus contention problem.  If
                                           this counter is incrementing then
                                           more than likely you have either
                                           have multiple NE2100 or NE1500T
                                           cards in the server or another Bus
                                           Mastering Device in the server (ie.
                                           disk channel). 

          TxBabblingError                  This counter increments when there
                                           is excessive length in the transmit
                                           buffer.  It will increment after
                                           1519 data bytes have been
                                           transmitted from the buffer.  It
                                           indicates that the transmitter has
                                           been on the channel longer than the
                                           time required to send the maximum
                                           length packet.  This counter would
                                           indicate a hardware NIC card
                                           problem in the server.

          TxUnderflowError                 This counter increments when
                                           something else on the bus takes
                                           control of the bus while the LAN
                                           driver is putting the data on the
                                           wire.  The packet would then have
                                           to be retransmitted.

          TXBufferError                    This counter increments when there
                                           is a problem with the transmit
                                           buffer.  This counter will also
                                           commonly increment when
                                           TxUnderflowError increments.  This
                                           counter could be indicative of
                                           hardware problem in the server.

          RxECBsOver16MegCount             This counter will increment when a
          TxECBsOver16MegCount             transmit or receive occurs and the
                                           driver has had to use the reserved
                                           buffers below 16 meg double buffer
                                           the ECB because the card can't
                                           access above 16 Meg of memory
                                           (physical limitation).  The NE1500T
                                           and NE2100 cards are not able to
                                           access memory above 16 MB.
                                           Therefore, if the operating system
                                           issues an Event Control Block (ECB)
                                           with an address above 16MB of
                                           memory, the board uses some of the
                                           reserved buffers below 16MB to
                                           queue the request.  These are not
                                           errors.  They are only keeping
                                           track of how many ECBs were
                                           redirected to the buffers below
                                           16MB.   In many cases, this counter
                                           can be as high as the total packets
                                           sent and received.  Because of this
                                           double buffering that occurs it
                                           does cause a performance hit.  Any
                                           board that is busmastering or uses
                                           DMA that is not a 32 bit adapter
                                           will potentially experience a
                                           performance hit if you have more
                                           than 16 MB of ram.

                                           for 3.11 servers, it can be changed
                                           in the STARTUP.NCF), and we need an
                                           extra 4 bytes to receive a near
                                           full size packet to include the CRC
                                           on the end of the packet we will
                                           use 2 ECBs.  This is a slight
                                           performance hit to use 2 ECBs
                                           instead of one but will function
                                           properly. NOTE: Netware 3.12 and
                                           4.X default the Maximum Physical

          Transmit Retry Failure:       This counter increments when the
                                        driver is unable to transmit a packet
                                        a reset number of times.  This may
                                        indicate a hardware problem.

          Tx Clear To Sends Errors:     Attempt to catch an 82586 errata. 
                                        There are some conditions when the
                                        clear to send signal from the 82586
                                        chip is incorrect.  This indicates the
                                        number of times the corrective code on
                                        the adapter was executed to work
                                        around this condition in the 82586.

          Tx DMA Underrun Errors:       Attempt to catch an 82586 errata. 
                                        This can occur when contention between
                                        the BMIC, 80186 and 82586 occurs on
                                        the adapter.  The 82586 thinks it did
                                        not get all of the packet for
                                        transmission. The transmit operation
                                        must be retried in this case.  This
                                        indicates the number of times the
                                        corrective code on the adapter was
                                        executed to work around this
                                        condition.

          Rx DMA Overrun Errors:        Attempt to catch an 82586 errata.  If
                                        two packets are received back to back
                                        at near the minimum ethernet
                                        inter-frame spacing of 9.6
                                        microseconds then the chip may report
                                        an overrun.  If so, the frames are
                                        lost by the chip and the source will
                                        have to re-transmit.

          Rx Packet Slide Errors:       Attempt to catch an 82586 anomaly.  In
                                        some strange conditions, the 82586 may
                                        get off by two bytes in the receive
                                        packet descriptors. This number
                                        indicates the number of times this
                                        condition occurred. The sending
                                        station must retransmit the packet in
                                        this case.

          Rx Dummy RCB Used Errors:     Attempt to catch an 82586 errata.  In
                                        some cases, the 82586 may attempt to
                                        receive data into a non-existent
                                        receive buffer off the end of its
                                        receive buffer list.  To catch for
                                        this condition and avoid internal data
                                        corruption, a dummy receive buffer is
                                        added to the end of the list.  This
                                        variable counts the number of times
                                        the 82586 attempted to write into the
                                        dummy buffer.


          Internal Adapter Reset:       This is count of the number of resets
                                        in that occurred on the adapter (by
                                        the 80186) due to failures on the
                                        adapter.  This counter increments when
                                        the software corrects itself for minor
                                        problems or if the card gets into an
                                        unknown state. This counter commonly
                                        increments.  Under normal conditions,
                                        more of these errors should occur
                                        during idle time than when the driver
                                        is busy.  For this counter to warn you
                                        of potential hardware problems, you
                                        must receive thousands of these errors
                                        when the network is busy.


          Mondo Fragment Length Errors: An NLM on the Server has passed the
                                        NE3200 driver an ECB whose logical
                                        memory address we couldn't change to a
                                        physical memory address. You should
                                        check other NLMs on the system and
                                        upgrade them.  If you are still
                                        experiencing problems identify which
                                        NLM is causing the problem and contact
                                        the third party manufacturer of the
                                        NLM.

          Polling Timeout:              The adapters request was put on the
                                        que but because the server was busy it
                                        was not able to be serviced within 800
                                        nanoseconds (default).  If this occurs
                                        the adapter will then fire an
                                        interrupt to get serviced.

          Reset Because Hardware Died Errors:     If the adapter gets in an
                                        unknown state or stops transmitting on
                                        the host side the driver will
                                        increment this counter will
                                        reset/restart the adapter.  

          Number Of Interrupts Fired:   This counter increments each time the
                                        adapter had to fire an interrupt to
                                        service a request because the polled
                                        request wasn't serviced.

          FIFOUnderRunCount             This counter increments usually during
                                        high utilization or high BUS usage and
                                        we are unable to send the packet. 
                                        This should occur rarely.

          ByteCountMismatchCount        This counter increments when the
                                        transmit packet size is not = to sum
                                        of fragments passed to the SONIC chip
                                        on board.  This should occur rarely.

          HardTransmitErrorCount        This counter increments when a CRC,
                                        Excessive Deferral, ByteCount
                                        MismatchCount, or FIFOUnderRunCount
                                        occurs on a transmit.  This is more of
                                        a general transmit error counter.

          TransmitCollisionsCount       This counter increments when the card
                                        can't transmit on the wire.  If the
                                        card takes 5 times to get the packet
                                        transmitted this counter will be
                                        incremented by 4.

          OutOfWindowCollisionCount     This counter increments when an
                                        illegal collision occurs.  The
                                        collision should normally be during
                                        the preamble.  If the collision
                                        incorrectly occurs after the preamble
                                        this counter will increment.  This
                                        should be rare.

          CRCErrorCount                 This counter increments when a packet
                                        is received by the card with a bad
                                        CRC. 

          FIFOOverrunCount              This counter increments when a packet
                                        is received and there are errors in
                                        the packet. The driver looks at the
                                        FIFO overrun counter to determine if
                                        there are errors.  The packet is not
                                        received if there are errors.

          RDAExhaustCount               This counter increments when the
                                        driver can't take the data out of the
                                        buffer fast enough to process it and
                                        the Receive Descriptor Area is
                                        overflowed.  This shouldn't happen
                                        very often but is more likely under
                                        high utilization.

          RRAExhaustCount               This counter increments when the
                                        driver can't take the data out of the
                                        buffer fast enough to process it and
                                        the Receive Resource Area is
                                        overflowed.  This shouldn't happen
                                        very often but is more likely under
                                        high utilization.

          RBAExceedCount                This counter increments when the
                                        driver can't take the data out of the
                                        buffer fast enough to process it and
                                        the Receive Buffer Area is overflowed.
                                        This shouldn't happen very often but
                                        is more likely under high utilization.

          FlagFoundCount                This counter increments when the RIC
                                        chip on the card reports an error such
                                        as (Jabber, Out of window Collision
                                        etc.)

          PacketsCompressedCount        This counter increments when the
                                        driver is in promiscuous mode and is
                                        looking at every packet.  To get the
                                        management information efficiently the
                                        driver only copies the first 50 bytes
                                        of the packet into the buffer and then
                                        adds on the 7 bytes of management
                                        information on the end of the packet.
                                        This occurs only on the packets that
                                        are not destined for the server when
                                        the driver is loaded with PCOMP=ENABLE
                                        (default).  

          RICAddressWasInvalidCount     This counter increments when the RIC
                                        address was corrupt on a receive
                                        management packet.  The driver expects
                                        this number to be correct.  That is
                                        why the driver checks the RIC address.

          TxTimeOutCount                This counter increments when a
                                        transmit doesn't occur in 2 seconds. 

          Port0ErrorCount               This counter increments when the port
                                        address is set to 0. The port address
                                        should always be between 1 and 12. 
                                        This will not occur frequently.

          PortBigErrorCount             This counter increments when the port
                                        address is above 13. The port address
                                        should always be between 1 and 12.
                                        This will not occur frequently.

          ValidCRCCount                 This counter increments when the
                                        Management Information overlaying the
                                        CRC is correct.  It should be
                                        incorrect.  This should happen rarely.

          Bad Correlator Count          This counter increments when a network
                                        board responds with a request for data
                                        from the file server that the file
                                        server does not have.  The ECB or some
                                        other code may be corrupted. 
                                        Eventually, this type of error will
                                        down the server.  If this counter is
                                        non-zero, you should try to find the
                                        software that is corrupting the data.

          
          Unknown ARB requests          This counts bad ARBs (Adapter Request
                                        Blocks).  Normally the network board
                                        (adapter) uses one of four known
                                        commands to communicate with the
                                        driver.  If a network board sends a
                                        command that is NOT one of the four,
                                        the driver does not recognize the
                                        request.  This is not a catastrophic
                                        error.   Sometimes old adapters send
                                        bad ARB requests because of software
                                        problems resident on the board. 
                                        NetWare responds to the network board
                                        so that the board will not hang.

          MicroChannel Error Count:     Adapter ran into a problem
                                        transmitting on the Bus. The Adapter
                                        Interrupt occurred from the firmware
                                        on the card.

          ECBs Over 16Meg:              The number of packets received that
                                        had to use an ECB over 16 meg.  This
                                        number should only increment when
                                        using more than 16 meg of ram in the
                                        F/S.

          DMA Bus Errors Count:         This counter is incremented when a DMA
                                        transfer completes with a bus error.
                                        If this increments it could be
                                        indicative of a hardware problem.

          DMA Parity Errors Count:      This counter is incremented when a DMA
                                        transfer completes with a parity
                                        error. If this increments it could be
                                        indicative of a hardware problem.

          Command Reject Count:         This counter is incremented when the
                                        Driver sends a command to the card and
                                        the command is either invalid or the
                                        card is still busy processing the
                                        previous command.  This number should
                                        be 0 or low.

          Tx Timeout Count:             This counter is incremented and the
                                        adapter is reset if 2 seconds elapses
                                        and the driver hasn't heard back from
                                        the firmware that the transmit was or
                                        wasn't successful.  This counter shows
                                        the driver successfully recovering
                                        from the lost hardware transmit.  It
                                        is OK to see this number increment.

          Transmit Late Count:          This counter will increment when the
                                        driver thought that the card was
                                        transmitting more than it really was
                                        because of what was reported by the
                                        firmware.  The data that wasn't
                                        transmitted will then be sent in the
                                        next packet.  This is a latency type
                                        of issue.  You will likely see more of
                                        these errors on a busier network.  

          Transmit Defragment Count:    The IBM Token-Ring DMA LAN boards are
                                        not able to access memory above 16 MB.
                                        Therefore, if the operating system
                                        issues an Event Control Block (ECB)
                                        with an address above 16MB of memory, 
                                        the board uses some of the reserved
                                        buffers below 16MB to queue the
                                        request.  These are not errors.  They
                                        are only keeping track of how many
                                        ECBs were redirected to the buffers
                                        below 16MB.   In many cases, this
                                        counter can be as high as the total
                                        packets sent and received.  Because of
                                        this double buffering that occurs it
                                        does cause a performance hit.  Any
                                        board that is busmastering or uses DMA
                                        that is not a 32 bit adapter will
                                        potentially experience a performance
                                        hit if you have more than 16 MB of
                                        ram.

          HotCarrierInterruptCount      This counter increments when the board
                                        detects a carrier longer than expected
                                        without a transmit.  This Generally
                                        indicates that some board on the
                                        network has failed or is starting to
                                        go bad.

          No82588InterruptCount         This counter increments each time it
                                        receives an interrupt from the card
                                        but not the 82588 chip.  This should
                                        never happen.

          WeirdInterruptCount           This counter increments when the file
                                        server has received an interrupt from
                                        the card, but the card claims not to
                                        have sent one.  This should never
                                        happen.

          BadTransmitCompleteInterruptCount       This counter increments for
                                        each complete transmission with no
                                        transmit active.

          HardTransmitErrorCount        This counter increments when a
                                        transmit fails and the driver retries
                                        the transmit.

          GotNothingCount               This counter increments when the
                                        driver receives an interrupt from the
                                        card indicating that it has completed
                                        a receive but there is no data in the
                                        card's receive buffer.  This is not
                                        serious.

          ReceiveUnderrunErrorCount     This counter increments when the
                                        driver finds less data in the card's
                                        buffer than the card said was there.

          ReceivedShortPacketCount      This counter increments when a packet
                                        of less than 17 bytes is received.

          BadReceiveConditionCodeCount  This counter increments when the
                                        buffer is flushed because the card
                                        hasn't received the incoming packets
                                        properly.
