Fixes carried over from IPXRT4:
---------------------------------

1. The SAP from a print server, was not aged out, if RIP and SAP were in
AUTO mode.

2. Wildcard filters inappropriately applied the source of the packet, to
all interfaces.

3. The server responded with the nearest Directory Server, when SET REPLY
TO GET NEAREST SERVER was set to OFF.

4. An IPXRTRNM abend.

5. Failure of IPXCON to display a level 2 neighbor.


Fixes carried over from 41RTR4:
--------------------------------

 1. After applying IPXRTR.NLM from 41RTR3.EXE or a build date of 11/28/95 or
newer, the SFT III IO engine abended at IPXRTR.

   2. Wrong number of hops and ticks value were reported when one of the SFT
III IO engines went down.

   3. Fixed ABEND problem when entering "set load balance local lan=on"
command on SFT III system.

   4. IPXRTR routeless services were not retained if an IPX Default Route
was present.

   5. IPXRTR was forwarding SAP packets that advertised an unreachable server
(16 hops away) even when the ROUTING=NONE parameter was used.

  6. No Load Balancing between server and local clients.

  7. An abend, if an SPX application sent a packet to the internal network
(such as NXPIPX.NLM module of NetExplorer) while load balancing for the local
 LAN was turned on, using the SET LOAD BALANCE command.

  8. Frame type set incorrectly, for IPX, if the default was not selected.

  9. The SAP from a print server, was not aged out, if RIP and SAP were
operating in AUTO mode.

  10. Wildcard filters applied inappropriately, to the source of the packet to
all interfaces.

  11. Responding with the nearest Directory Server, if the SET REPLY TO GET
NEAREST SERVER option was off.  (Because, IPXRTR did not allow static routes or
 services to be added, to a link, that was not using static routing.)

  12. IPXRTRNM abended on the NetWare Client for Windows.

  13. IPXCON did not display some neighbors.

 
FEATURES carried over from IPXRT4.EXE:
--------------------------------------

F1. Routeless Services
Originally, IPX Services were absorbed only if the network number on which the
service resides was explicitly reachable.  If a default route (FF-FF-FF-FE
network number) is defined for IPX, IPXRTR will optionally absorb services
without an explicit route to the service being reachable.

This is implemented via a SET command. By default, IPXRTR requires a explicit
network number for the service to be reachable.  By using a SET command the 
check for an explicit network number before absorbing services is removed.

The syntax of the set command is: set required network for services= <on> /
<off>.

By default the SET is ON.   This means that IPXRTR will check to see if the
network number on which a service resides is explicitly reachable.  If the service 
is reachable, the service will be absorbed, otherwise it will be dropped.

Note: The IPX default route cannot be explicity created on a server running
IPXRTR. The IPX default route can only be learned from another IPX router that
is configured to originate the IPX default route.

If set to OFF, IPXRTR will check to see if the network number on which the
service resides is explicitly reachable.  If so, the service will be absorbed. 
If the network number is not reachable IPXRTR will check to see if there is a
default route (FF-FF-FF-FE network number).  If a default route is present and
reachable, the service will be absorbed.
If an explicit route and the default route are not reachable, the service will
be dropped.

F2. Ability to bind multiple NICs to a single network number.

F3. Load balancing, which is useful when connecting two or more interfaces on
a file server to an Ethernet switch.
 
F4. SNMP instrumentation for IPX, RIP/SAP, and NLSP, along with an IPX console
(IPXCON.NLM). 

F5. NLSP, a link state routing protocol for IPX that greatly reduces routing
overhead and provides more diagnostics on the operation of IPX and IPX routing.

F6. IPXPING.NLM, a utility that tests connectivity between systems running
IPXRTR.

F7. Use of the NetWare 3.12 hashing algorithm for RIP/SAP processing, which
greatly reduces CPU utilization on NetWare 3.11 in large IPX RIP networks.
 
F8. Ability to turn off IPX routing on servers with multiple NICs.
 
F9. Filtering of NetBIOS packets, which is enabled by a SET command.

F10. Ability for NLSP to switch automatically from broadcast to multicast when
all NLSP nodes on a LAN support multicast.

F11. Three product MIBs that you can integrate with Novell and third-party
network management software.  These ASN.1 text files are in SUPP\REFMIBS. Refer
to the documentation for these products for information about
installing additional MIBs.


FEATURES carried over from 41RTR4.EXE:
--------------------------------------

  F1. IPXRTR.NLM can now run on the Japanese version of NetWare.

  F2. A new INETCFG.NLM provides improved conversion of load commands, from
NetWare for Macintosh to the INETCFG database.

  F3. NLSP can now switch automatically from Broadcast to Multicast, if all
NLSP nodes on the LAN support multicast.

  F4. For an OS/2 enviroment, new BRIDGE and PARSER NLMs provide bridging
which
 can now work concurrently over X.25 and Frame Relay.

  F5. For an OS/2 enviroment, a new LLC8022.NLM which provides LAN Network
 Manager functionality.
