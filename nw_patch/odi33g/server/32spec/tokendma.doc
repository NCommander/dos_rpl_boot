Installing and Setting the IBM Token-Ring 16/4 Busmaster Server Adapter/A

The IBM Token-Ring 16/4 Busmaster Server Adapter/A is functionally different
from the IBM Token-Ring 16/4 Adapter/A in two ways:

þ    Busmaster capability

Busmastering allows the IBM Token-Ring Network 16/4 Busmaster Server Adapter/A
to transfer between the network and the server's memory without the aid of the
server's CPU.  The server's CPU can then process other network tasks more
quickly than it otherwise could.

þ    Downloadable microcode

Downloading microcode allows you to upgrade the IBM Token-Ring Network 16/4
Busmaster Server Adapter/A's firmware without replacing any chips on the
adapter.  FIRMLOAD.COM (supplied by Novell) allows you to download the
firmware (supplied by IBM) to the adapter.

Before you install this adapter in a 3.1x server, you should have designed
your network and assembled the necessary hardware.  If you have any questions
about Token-Ring hardware or network layout, see the Novell IBM Token-Ring
Network Supplement manual for further information.

For information concerning installation and configuration of the 16/4
Busmaster card, please refer to the IBM Token-Ring Network 16/4 Busmaster
Server Adapter/A Installation and Testing Instructions that accompany the
adapter.  Additional information concerning the following setable parameters
can be found in the "change configuration" selection in the Reference program:

þ    Data rate

The default data rate for the adapter is 4 Mbps. The other valid data rate is
16 Mbps.

Important:  You must set all IBM Token-Ring 16/4 adapters on a ring to use the
same data rate (either 16 Mbps or 4 Mbps).  Failure to do so will cause
network errors.

þ    Interrupt level

The default is Interrupt 2.

Other valid levels include interrupts 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12.

þ    I/O address

The default I/O address is 86A0-86AF.

Each valid address consists of a 16-byte block of RAM within the Micro Channel
machine.  There are seven additional valid I/O addresses:  96A0, A6A0, B6A0,
C6A0, D6A0, E6A0, and F6A0.

Ensure each adapter installed in the machine has a unique I/O address.

þ    Arbitration level

The default arbitration level is E.

Other valid arbitration levels are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, and D.

Each busmaster adapter requires a unique arbitration level for negotiating
with other busmaster adapters within the same machine for control of the
microchannel bus.

þ    Fairness

The default is to operate with fairness ON.

The other valid option is to operate with fairness OFF.

Fairness determines how a Micro Channel busmaster adapter negotiates with
other busmaster adapters within the same machine for control of the
microchannel bus.

For more information about arbitration and fairness, read the IBM publication,
PS/2 Hardware Technical Reference.

þ    Bus release

The default is "Maximum."

The other valid setting is "Immediately."

The bus release setting determines how long a Micro Channel busmaster adapter
has to relinquish the bus when another adapter preempts it during a DMA
operation.

A setting of "Immediately" causes the adapter to relinquish control of the
Micro Channel bus upon receiving the preempt signal.

A setting of "Maximum" allows the adapter time to finish critical DMA
operations, resulting in better overall performance.

þ    Early Token Release (ETR)

When the data rate is 16 Mbps, the default is to operate with ETR.

The other valid option is NO ETR.

Operation with ETR is not valid for Token-Rings with a data rate of 4 Mbps.

ETR can increase network performance by causing the adapter to release the
token immediately upon deencapsulating the data packet, rather than after it
has successfully transferred the deencapsulated data to the next higher
network protocol.

DOWNLOADING the Microcode

IMPORTANT
The Microcode must be downloaded to the Busmaster Server Adapter/A each time
the machine is powered up.  This can be accomplished manually (from the
command line) or can be automated in a batch file.

The IBM Token-Ring 16/4 Busmaster Server Adapter/A requires microcode that is
not resident on the adapter.  The microcode is contained in two files included
on the adapter's option diskette (supplied by IBM):

þ    MONT400.BIN

þ    WRTRAM.BIN

To download MONT400.BIN and WRTRAM.BIN to the adapter, you must use
FIRMLOAD.COM, a utility supplied by Novell.

When you have located these three files (including FIRMLOAD.COM), complete the
following steps:

1.   Copy the MONT400.BIN, WRTRAM.BIN, and FIRMLOAD.COM files to the same
diskette (or to the same directory).

2.   Change to drive or directory that contains MONT400.BIN, WRTRAM.BIN, and
FIRMLOAD.COM.

3.   Type the following:

          FIRMLOAD  <Enter>

     A message similar to the following appears:

  Applies to NetWare 3.11 only

The loader portion of SERVER.EXE will need to be modified to properly load the
new TOKENDMA.LAN driver.  To make this change in SERVER.EXE, you need to use
XLOAD.EXE and LDR001.PTF.  Novell recommends patching SERVER.EXE on NetWare
3.11 servers except NetWare  SFT III 3.11.  NetWare 3.12 does not require the
new loader because it is built into SERVER.EXE.

For more information about XLOAD and LDR001, read XLOAD.DOC and LDR001.DOC. 
XLOAD should always be applied when using interrupts 2 and 9 on Micro Channel
bus machines.
