


This DOSGEN.DOC file is for DOSGEN.EXE and both are included within
the NOVELL RPL KIT


DOSGEN.EXE is version 1.21 and provides the following
enhancements:

*  Allows subdirectories to be part of the disk image (net$dos.sys).

*  Can now reverse a disk image back onto a floppy diskette provided
   the diskette is the same density and format as the original disk
   image diskette.


Syntax for dosgen.exe is as follows:

DOSGEN [options] [<Drive>] [<FileName>]
options: /u - Copy disk image to floppy
         /? - Display syntax help
         default - Create disk image from floppy

    
Example #1:

DOSGEN A: IMAGE.SYS<ENTER>

This will create IMAGE.SYS in the same directory that dosgen.exe is in.
IMAGE.SYS will be an exact image of the floppy diskette that is in the
A: drive.

 
Example #2:

DOSGEN<ENTER>

This will create NET$DOS.SYS in the same directory that dosgen.exe is
in.  NET$DOS.SYS will be an exact image of the floppy diskette that is
in the A: drive.  This is the default.


Example #3:

DOSGEN /?<ENTER>

Displays the following help information:

DOSGEN [options] [<Drive>] [<FileName>]
options: /u - Copy disk image to floppy
         /? - Display syntax help
         default - Create disk image from floppy



Example #4:

DOSGEN /U NET$DOS.SYS B:<ENTER>

This will write NET$DOS.SYS to the floppy diskette in the B: drive.
The B: diskette must be the same density and format as the diskette
used to dosgen NET$DOS.SYS.
