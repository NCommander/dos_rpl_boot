ABSTRACT:

This file contains the latest LAN ODI Specification Version  3.31 support
modules (NBI, MSM, TSMs, etc.) for Novell NetWare file servers.
ONLY Specification Version 3.2 is supported for NetWare 4.10.
LAN drivers written by Novell are also included.
(There are no third party LAN drivers included.)
This new ODI spec adds support for Hot Plug PCI, and for 
removing a single instance of a driver.
NetWare for SAA users need to review the section titled 
"Instructions for NetWare for SAA customers" in the Issue section.
 
DO NOT USE ODI33G with:
NetWare Connect 2.0 (or lower),
MPR 3.0 (or lower), or 
If NIAS v4.0 or MPR v3.1 is installed ODIWANx.EXE is also required.
If support pack was installed on the server and there was no entry for MPR in
the products.dat file you will need to reinstall MPR and then reinstall the
support pack to get the MPR updates.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

****************************************************************
  Note: This ODI update is for English only.
****************************************************************

Before installing, make sure the following items have been completed.

410PTx.EXE (Where "x" is 6 or higher) must be installed on NetWare v4.10 file
servers prior to installing ODI33G.EXE. Without this patch the following
message may be displayed when NBI.NLM loads.

"Warning: This version of NetWare does not support protected mode BIOS
accesses. Without a loader patch some PCI drivers may fail."

312PTx.EXE (Where "x" is 8 or higher) must be installed on NetWare v3.12 file
servers prior to installing ODI33G.EXE.  Without this patch the following
message may be displayed when NBI.NLM loads.

"Warning: This version of NetWare does not support protected mode BIOS
accesses. Without a loader patch some PCI drivers may fail."

Note: If NIAS V4.0 or MPR V3.1 is installed, ODIWANx.EXE must also be install
after ODI33G to update the WAN drivers for these products. The shipping
versions of these products contain WAN drivers that will not load with the ODI
3.31 Specification Version support files.

Note: Do not install the ODI Specification Version 3.31 support files update
kit on file servers that have NetWare Connect 2.0 (or lower), MPR 3.0 (or
lower), or NetWare for SAA. The WAN drivers in these products will not load
with the ODI Specification Version 3.31 support files. The install checks for
these specific products, and the install will not allow the ODI Specification
Version 3.31 support files update kit to be installed if they exist.

Note: 32-bit LAN drivers written to the "C" spec v1.10 will not work with the
current ODI Specification Version 3.31 support modules. There has been only one
third party driver (CMDGODI.LAN 06/07/96 124292) certified to the "C" spec
v1.10. If this driver is being used, do not update to the current ODI
Specification Version 3.31 support modules until an updated driver from Madge
written to the "C" Specification Version v1.11 is available to be used.  All of
Novell's "C" Specification Version v1.10 LAN drivers have been updated to the
"C" Specification Version v1.11, and are included.

Note: CNE2100.LAN and CNE1500T.LAN will be replaced with CNEAMD.LAN. If you
were using CNE2100.LAN or CNE1500T.LAN, the configuration file that loaded this
driver will need to be changed to match the new name CNEAMD.LAN. On file
servers this will be AUTOEXEC.NCF or INETCFG.NLM.

Make a backup of LAN drivers and support modules (NBI, MSM, and TSMs). This is
important in case third party LAN drivers have problems with the new ODI
support modules. The 4.1x install puts the existing NBI, MSM, and TSMs in
sys:system\oldlan. However, it was not possible to do this with the install
script for 3.1x.

ODIKIT Installation Instructions on 4.1X/4.20 versions of NetWare using
INSTALL.NLM.
=======================================================

Novell has provided an installation script to be used with INSTALL.NLM
"Product Options".

  This script file can be run in several ways:
  1- From a local A: drive at the file server <Enter> or <F3>.
  2- From a local drive at the client using Rconsole <F4>.
  3- From a local volume at the file server <F3>, by specifying the path
  including volume name..ie SYS:\.
  4- From a different file server on the network <F3> by specifying full path
  including server name..ie Server_Name\SYS:\.

  NOTE: The fastest installation in order of performance is: option 3, option
  4, option 2, option 1.
 ________________________________________________________________
     
 Installation Instructions on 4.1X/4.20 versions of NetWare:

    1) Extract ODI33G to a Network drive or a local hard drive according to
the install option desired. All of the files in ODI33G will not fit onto a
diskette. If you need to use a diskette to install; copy *.nlm and *.ips from
the root of ODI33G, the "Server" directory structure and files from ODI33G,
and the "RPL" directory structure and files from ODI33G onto a diskette.

    2) Load Install at the file server.

    3) Select "Product options".

    4) Select "Install a product not listed".

    5) Choose the install option (<F3>, <F4>, or <Enter>).

    6) Enter the path to the location where ODI33G was extracted. If <Enter>
    was used in the previous step, the root of A: at the file server is used.

    7) At this point two file groups will be displayed.  Mark the file group
    that is to be installed. Only one file group may be selected. The v3.2     
Specification Version file group may not be installed on NetWare v4.11 or    
v4.20.

    8) Press <F10> to continue.

Note:  The files copied to the dos partition on each IOEngine on SFT III File
Servers will have the date of the machine when they were copied.

ISSUE: 

This ODI update is for English only.

Do not install the ODI Specification Version 3.31 support files update kit on
file servers that have NetWare Connect 2.0 (or lower), MPR 3.0 (or lower), or
NetWare for SAA.
The WAN drivers in these products will not load with the ODI Specification
Version 3.31 support files. The install checks for these specific products, and
the install will not allow the ODI Specification Version 3.31 support files
update kit to be installed if they exist.
If NIAS V4.0 or MPR V3.1 is installed, ODIWANx.EXE must also be installed after
ODI33G to update the WAN drivers for these products. The shipping versions of
these products contain WAN drivers that will not load with the ODI
Specification Version 3.31 support files.

ODI33G contains updated ODI Specification Version 3.31/1.11 LAN drivers written
by Novell, and updated ODI Specification Version 3.31 support modules (NBI,
MSM, TSMs, etc.) for Novell file servers. 
This file does not contain any third party LAN drivers. This ODI spec adds
support for Hot Plug PCI, and for removing a single instance of a LAN driver.

For details on the ODI spec and possible issues with third party HSM
(Hardware Specific Module) LAN drivers, see the "HSM Specification Description
and Issues Section" below.

For syntax on removing a single instance of a LAN driver, see the "ODI
Selective Unload User Interface Instructions" below.

Details on changes to specific files are given in the "ODI Files Updates and
Changes Section" below.

Instructions for NetWare for SAA customers:

These notes apply only to users of NetWare for SAA 3.0 and earlier installed
on NetWare 4.11 or NW 4.2.  NetWare for SAA 4.0 includes these APARs.

1) Any installed drivers must be ODI Specification Version 3.31 compatible. 
This is only an issue for NW4.11 where the driver update option was not
selected when installing SP6.

2) All NWSAA customers with LLC8022.NLM version earlier than 6.04 must
copy the LLC8022.NLM from the appropriate IBM APAR to the SYS:\SYSTEM
directory.  IBM APAR JR12795 is for NWSAA 3.0, JR12979 for NWSAA 2.2,
or JR12978 for NWSAA 2.0.

3) Customers who are using NWSAA with SDLC, X.25 or Frame Relay
should install the NIAS41 component included with NW4.2 or, in the case of
NW4.11, SP6 and NIAS41. Then do the following:

a) copy the SDLCTSM.NLM contained in the appropriate IBM APAR to SYS:\SYSTEM
directory.
Failure to copy the SDLCTSM.NLM BEFORE the server is restarted may cause the
server to ABEND after the ODI Specification Version 3.31 support has been
installed.

b)  Do NOT copy the CSL.NLM dated 12-14-1994 from the IBM APAR

c)  Those customers who are installing NWSAA v3.0 for the first time should
install the NIAS41.EXE only after first installing the NWSAA v3.0
software. Otherwise installing NWSAA v3.0 will downlevel the X.25 support
modules.

d)  If you are using Frame Relay
then you also need to update the Frame Relay support modules. Download BOTH the
NIAS41.EXE file and the NWSAAHPR.EXE file from support.novell.com to obtain the
updated Frame Relay support modules that work with the ODI v3.31 drivers
installed by Support Pack 6 (NW4.2 users just need the NWSAAHPR.EXE
file.)

****************************************************************
  HSM Specification Description and Issues Section.
****************************************************************

There are two server HSM (Hardware Specific Module) specifications that LAN
drivers can be written to. They are (1) the 32-bit Assembly HSM Specification
Version , currently at v3.31, and (2) the 32-bit "C" HSM spec, currently at
v1.11. If LAN drivers have been certified by Novell Labs, the Novell Labs test
bulletin will list the HSM Specification Version that the driver was written
to.

The current ODI Specification Version 3.31 support modules (NBI, MSM, TSMs,
etc.) in ODI33G that allow 32-bit LAN drivers to load on Novell file servers
will support 32-bit LAN drivers written to the Assembly spec v3.31, Assembly
spec v3.30, and "C" spec v1.11. Most 32-bit LAN drivers that are written to the
Assembly 3.20 spec should run on the current ODI Specification Version
3.31/1.11 support modules. 
However, some Assembly 3.20 spec drivers may have problems. The ODI support
modules that were written to support the Assembly 3.20 spec LAN drivers have
been included for customers who currently have Assembly 3.20 spec LAN drivers
that will not work with the current ODI Specification Version 3.31 support
modules.

The HSM "C" spec v1.10 was the first HSM "C" spec supported. The HSM "C" spec
v1.10 was first available at the same time the Assembly HSM v3.30 spec was
available. 32-bit LAN drivers written to the "C" spec v1.10 will not work with
the current ODI Specification Version 3.31 support modules. There has been only
one third party driver (CMDGODI.LAN 06/07/96 124292) certified to the "C" spec
v1.10.  If this driver is being used, do not update to the current ODI
Specification Version 3.31 support modules until an updated driver from Madge
written to the "C" spec v1.11 is available to be used.  All of Novell's "C"
spec v1.10 LAN drivers have been updated to the "C" spec v1.11, and are
included.

The ODI Specification Version 3.20 support modules and Assembly spec v3.20 LAN
drivers have not been tested on and are not supported on NetWare file servers
starting with v4.11. They can be tried, but the results are unknown.

The latest ODI Specification Version support modules and LAN drivers that can
be run on NetWare v3.12 and v3.2 are the ODI 3.31 support modules and Assembly
spec v3.31 and "C" spec v1.11 LAN Drivers. However, LAN drivers written to the
Assembly spec earlier than v3.31 must use the ODI Specification Version 3.20
support modules and Assembly spec v3.20 LAN drivers written by Novell. They are
included for NetWare v3.12
and v3.2.

New Command Line Verbs and /or Entry Points

The following five commands have been added to the server's command set, for
use with the server's existing command capability. These commands are available
only after installing the 3.31 ODI Specification Version support modules.

 1) REMOVE NETWORK INTERFACE <logical board #> | <logical board name>

This function will remove an instance of a logical board. This function is
only supported on HSMs written to the C spec v1.11 and Assembly spec v3.31.

The boards' logical # corresponds to the order in which it shows up when
config is typed at the server console prompt or when load  <driver name> is
performed at the server prompt.

 2) REMOVE NETWORK ADAPTER <filename>,<BoardInstance number>

When using this function do not use the filename extensions, just use the
first part of the filename, i.e. CNEAMD. This function will remove all logical
boards associated with the specified adapter.

The combination of Filename and BoardInstance number uniquely identifies the
adapter (and all of its associated logical boards) to be removed. The
Monitor.nlm utility currently displays the BoardInstance number.

 3) SHUTDOWN NETWORK INTERFACE <logical board #> | <logical board name>

This function will do a partial shutdown of the specified logical board. This
function is only  supported on HSMs written to the C spec v1.11 and assembly
spec v3.31.

For an explanation about the logical board # see REMOVE NETWORK INTERFACE.

 4) RESET NETWORK ADAPTER <filename>,<BoardInstance number>

When using this function do not use the filename extensions, just use the
first part of the filename, i.e. CNEAMD. This command is simply a way to get to
the already existing DriverRest capability from the command line.

 5) RESET NETWORK INTERFACE <logical board #> | <logical board name>

For an explanation about the logical board # see REMOVE NETWORK INTERFACE.
This function calls HSM DriverReset to reset a single logical board. This
function is only supported on HSMs written to the C spec v1.11 and Assembly
spec v3.31.

  This may or may not be meaningful for a particular adapter/driver, if it is
not meaningful it would be a no-op.  Further, if it is meaningful, the exact
function may vary form driver to driver. WAN drivers are the most likely to
benefit from this command line function.

  ODI Files Updates and Changes Section.
 ****************************************************************
 
**NOVELL SERVER FILES** 

  MSM.NLM and MSM31X.NLM have been updated to improve performance and
reliability.
Support has been added for LAN drivers that perform high speed write combine
operations on newer hardware. Some issues during install have been corrected.
Improved debug capabilities added.  

The LAN Driver TSM modules have been updated to improve performance and
reliability. The following defects were corrected: some problems in the
handling of priority send packets, a rare problem in NetWare 4.x, where an
invalid memory pointer will ABend the server and a problem that caused
ManageWise to display a message stating that an invalid/unknown Source Node
Address was seen on a sent frame.
  
ROUTE.NLM
     A new command line parameter, RRTIME, is available for configuring how
long route entries remain active before the memory space is reused, so the
route table doesn't grow indefinitely. Another new command line parameter,
LOADBAL, causes existing route entries to get updated immediately when its path
changes, rather than waiting for a timeout to occur. Corrected problems
occuring on multiprocessor systems.


**LAN DRIVER FILES**

NOVELL 32 BIT ASSEMBLY LAN DRIVER FILES

  NE3200.LAN and NE3200P.LAN
Files have been updated to improve performance and reliability. Corrected a
promiscuous mode problem on receive frames. 

  NTR2000.LAN
File has been updated to improve performance and reliability.

NOVELL 32 BIT "C" HSM LAN DRIVER FILES

  CNE3200.LAN
Corrected a problem with unloading the driver, where resources were sometimes
not all returned to the OS.

  CNTR2000.LAN
Corrected an ABend problem that may occur when the driver attempts to display
a status message.
  
****************************************************************
 RPL Information.
****************************************************************

The RPL files that are needed for 16-bit Clients have also been 
included. For information on configuring RPL see the RPL documents in the 
RPL\RPLDOC directory.
