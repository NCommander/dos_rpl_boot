The following changes and updates have been made to LANDR6.EXE since
LANDR5.EXE:

The only change from LANDR5.EXE to LANDR6.EXE is that LSLENH.NLM and
PATCHMAN.NLM for NetWare 3.11 was added.  This was done because LSLENH.NLM is
no longer available in the NetWare 3.11 file server patch kit.

The following changes and updates have been made to LANDR5.EXE since
LANDR4.EXE:

 File server patches that are contained in other file server patch files were
removed.  The installation instructions list what patches are needed for what
versions of NetWare and where the patches can be found.

 ETHERTSM.NLM, FDDITSM.NLM, and TOKENTSM.NLM were updated. These files fixed a
problem where the RCONSOLE utility was not displaying server names.

 TOKEN.LAN was removed.  IBM now owns and distributes this file.  NTR2000.LAN
is Novell's equivalent driver.  Any adapter that will run using TOKEN.LAN will
also run using NTR2000.LAN.

 Some files in LANDR4.EXE were older than the corresponding files that shipped
with NetWare v4.10.  These files were updated to the current release.

LANDR4.EXE drivers included the following enhancements:

1.   ETHERTSM.NLM, TOKENTSM.NLM, and FDDITSM.NLM have been fixed to not
receive data from unregistered multi-cast addresses.

2.   ETHERTSM.NLM, TOKENTSM.NLM, and FDDITSM.NLM have been fixed to prevent
and invalid TCBFragStrucPtr from abending the server.  This would occur when
using 4.1 drivers with Lanalyzer Agent or using the drivers with any pre-scan
stack with "ECB aware" adapters (xxxxxxxxx)

3.   Previous NTR2000.LAN driver would disable its interrupt line when the TR
cable was disconnected.  The interrupt line is now enabled after the cable has
been disconnected then reconnected.

4.   Previous NTR2000.LAN driver would continuously reset the adapter when in
beaconing mode, causing the adapter to remain in the beaconing condition.  The
driver has been modified to not reset the adapter, thus not perpetuating the
beaconing condition.

5.   The NE2000 driver would allow conditions where an invalid Adapter
DataSpace pointer could ABEND the server.  This has been fixed.

6.   The NE15_21, NE2000, and NE2 drivers have minor bugs fixed to allow use
of derivative drivers on Unix platforms.

LANDR2.EXE drivers included the following enhancements:

The default frame type for Ethernet drivers became Ethernet_802.2 rather than
ethernet_802.3.  The ETHERTSM.NLM detected if the driver was being loaded on
NetWare 3.11 and defaulted to Ethernet_802.3.  If the operating system wasn't
NetWare 3.11,  the default frame type became Ethernet_802.2.

Drivers were updated to the latest Novell 4.0 specification.

NE2000.LAN was enhanced to use shared RAM for the NE2000+.

NE2100.LAN has been enhanced to take advantage of the new PCNET ISA chip set
from AMD.  This allowed the new clones that have this chipset to run faster.

NE3200.LAN  had some performance enhancements.  This newer driver in
combination with the newer .CFG file was more stable.  When using NE3200.LAN,
Novell support recommended selecting EDGE TRIGGERED interrupts when running
the EISA configuration and using the latest !NVL0701.CFG (DMA timing modified)
file supplied in LANDRx.EXE.

TOKEN.LAN was enhanced to use the FAST or QUICK path available on the IBM
NASSAU II FRU #74F9415.  This increased performance over early TOKEN.LAN
drivers using these boards in the file server.  If the driver didn't load with
the IBM Token Ring adapter installed, it was because the card was one of the
newer adapters from IBM that require the IBM-supplied driver (for example,
TOKENBM.LAN).

TOKENDMA.LAN - This driver was more reliable than previous drivers.  Because
the adapter was busmastering and not 32-bit, the driver had to double buffer
when writing above 16 MB of RAM.  The issue did not apply to servers with 16
MB or less of RAM.

TOKEN.LAN History

  TOKEN.LAN v3.15 was used with Novell's Communications Server NLM on a
NetWare 3.11 server.  It corrected lost connection problems when a workstation
was attached to a host through the COM-Server.  It also corrected a problem
that v3.13 (the version of the driver that currently ships with NetWare 3.11)
had with ABEND: GENERAL PROTECTION PROCESSOR EXCEPTION (GPPE). This GPPE
was
caused by beaconing out on the ring.

TOKEN.LAN fixed a problem not parsing the NODE override correctly.

TOKEN.LAN v3.18 (920129)

     TOKEN.LAN v3.18 provided the following corrective services:

Priority bits usage was modified from priority-1 to priority-0.

Transmit LSL-ECBs are returned back to the operating system if the ring is
beaconing.  This allowed the TOKEN.LAN send queue to remain manageable until
beaconing conditions on the ring were corrected.  The following error message
was resolved with this new TOKEN.LAN file:

MESSAGE

     LAN receive buffer limit reached.  All buffers are in
     use.  Possible causes are disk-channel bottleneck or
     buffers lost.

TOKEN.LAN v3.18 included an engineering change to work better with IBM
Token-Ring 1988 firmware.  If running a PROTOCOL in addition to IPX, TOKEN.LAN
assumed the 1988 IBM FIRMWARE transmitted frames in a particular order. 
TOKEN.LAN was  changed so that it made no assumptions about the transmit
order.

TRXNET.LAN - This driver was tested only with the Novell RX-NET RX-NET/2
boards.  It may or may not have worked with other cards or brands.  From a
support standpoint third-party vendors should have provided their own drivers
for their cards.

PCN2L.LAN - History from PCN23X.EXE NetWare 3.11.  This file contained a
revision of the NetWare 3.1x PCN2L.LAN file.  The PCN2L.LAN file fixed a
Remote Program Load problem.  The problem occurred when booting a workstation,
which received no response from the server, and the counter, located in the
upper-right-hand corner of the workstation's screen, continued to increment.



The server drivers originally provided in NE386.ZIP fixed the following:

These versions were rewritten to use the Media Support Module (MSM). The MSM
was the new tool (module) available to LAN driver developers from Novell to
develop better LAN drivers.

In some environments these new drivers could help solve communication
problems.

The file server could lock under a heavy load if it was a 486 machine and was
using an NE2000 or an NE/2 network board. A race condition existed where the
last remote DMA write cycle of the National Semiconductor DP8390 (on the
network board) prematurely terminated by writing to the Command Register with
bit "RD2" set before the remote DMA write cycle had completed.  These later
versions of the drivers addressed the issue.

On certain networks with high traffic the adapter would stop receiving.
