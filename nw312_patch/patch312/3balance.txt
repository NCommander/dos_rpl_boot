Load Balancing on a local LAN
-----------------------------
NOTE: This paper is based on the assumption that you are using the
IPXRTR.NLM in IPX65A.EXE (or later).

Scenario: 
You have 2, or more, network cards bound to the same IPX network number
(address) to different ports in the same switch.  You can get more
bandwidth from this LAN with Load Balancing.
 

A. How do I enable Load Balancing on the local LAN? 
1. Enable NLSP routing by loading the following NLMs on a 3.12 server:
      LOAD IPXSTACK
      LOAD IPXRTR routing=NLSP    

2. SET LOAD BALANCE LOCAL LAN = ON, after IPXRTR has been loaded (at the
AUTOEXEC.NCF is fine).
 
3. The Maximum Number of Path Splits must be established as 8.
That requires the following statements in SYS:ETC\NLSP.CFG:

       { GLOBAL
         MaxPaths=8;
       }

NOTE: If { GLOBAL
         }
already exists, insert MaxPaths=8 

 
B. How do I check that it's working? 
1. Load MONITOR (LAN/WAN Information) and compare the packets SENT from
each of the cards bound to the same IPX network number.  
The number of packets should be more or less equal, although one will be
slightly higher, as the server sends all non-broadcast NLSP packets onto an
IPX network through just one card.  Remember, the server has no control
over how packets are received - you may have only one client attached and
it will be sending all data to one card in the server.
 
2. With Load Balancing turned on, the server should only be sending one RIP
to the Specific Route Requests it receives.  You can check this in a
LANalyzer trace or with TRACK ON. 
 
 
C. What is the server doing differently that enables Load Balancing?
 
1. IPX NCP packets and Specific Route Response packets, destined for the
local LAN, will be sent from the NICs in a round robin fashion.  The NLSP
MaxPathSplits parameter tells IPXRTR how many duplicate, equal cost paths,
to store in its forwarding table.  When IPXRTR has a packet to send to
network 123, it looks in the forwarding table and uses the equal cost paths
to that network in a round robin.  (ie. This time the packet goes out NIC
1, next time NIC 2, NIC 3 and back to NIC 1, etc.)
 
2.  The server will only send one response for Specific Route RIP Requests.

When NetWare clients try to reach an IPX service, for the first time, they
broadcast a Specific Route Request for the IPX network number, where that
service resides (this is sometimes called a Get Local Target RIP Request). 
Because it is broadcast, this packet is received on all NICs bound to that
LAN.  Instead of responding through each NIC, IPXRTR will send only one RIP
response and that response will be part of the round robin for packets to
that LAN.
       
NetWare clients cache the MAC address provided in the RIP response, and
use it to reach that particular IPX network, until they lose the
connection.  In the context of Load Balancing, clients receive RIP
responses from random cards in the server (they are part of the round robin
of packets coming from the server), and this should help balance the
incoming load to the server.  Note that you may not see a well balanced
incoming load to a server with just a few clients - they all could be
sending to the same card in the server, and one could be sending a lot more
data than others.  Over time and with more clients, the incoming load
should become more balanced over the NICs.
 
D. Does this work for both RIP/SAP and NLSP? 
No, only NLSP, but that shouldn't cause any problems on your network
because NLSP is RIP/SAP compatible.
 
E. Why do you need to load IPXRTR and enable NLSP routing for Load
Balancing on the local LAN, when there are no routers in the picture?
  
The server will build and use a Forwarding Table with duplicate equal cost
routes - that results in the outgoing packets being balanced between the
NICs.  This is what NLSP allows.  Even when a packet is only going to the
local segment, IPXRTR needs to look in the Forwarding Table to find the
Next Hop to that segment.  Also, IPXRTR needs to see incoming Specific
Route Requests so that it knows to send only one response.  
Basically, IPXRTR should be handling all IPX packets coming and going from
the server, there is no logic for this in the old IPX routing software.
 
F. Will this Load Balancing effect the other segments the server is
attached to?
 
No, since those other segments have different IPX network numbers, they
will have different entries in the Forwarding Table and not be effected
by what's happening on your load balanced segment.  If, however, you have
doubled up the cards on several segments, the SET LOAD BALANCE LOCAL
LAN=ON will enable Load Balancing on all segments; there's no way to
balance on just one of those IPX networks.  It's either all or none.
 
 
G. Is it safe to do Load Balancing in a bridged token ring segment? 
 
Sometimes, but be careful!  In the scenario below it is safe to bind the
two NICs to the same IPX number.  HOWEVER, if you turn on Load Balancing,
sometimes the server will be sending packets to Client 2 out of NIC 1,
through the bridge.  This probably isn't what you want.  What you probably
want, is all traffic between Server and Client 2 to go through NIC2. 
Without Load Balancing, the server will respond to Specific RIP Requests
out of both NICs, and the Client2 will use the one it receives first - very
likely one out of NIC2.

DO NOT LOAD BALANCE IN THIS SCENARIO:
