ABSTRACT:

The 32SPEC directory contains the latest Novell LAN drivers and support 
modules for the v3.20 ODI Assembly Specification.  This is the latest 
ODI Assembly Specification that NetWare v3.11 and SFT III v3.11 will support.

ISSUE: 

The latest LAN Driver ODI Assembly Specification is 3.30.  However, NetWare
v3.11 and NetWare SFT III v3.11 do not support the new specification. 
The 32SPEC directory contains Novell drivers and support modules for the 
LAN Driver ODI Assembly Specification v3.20.  The ODI Assembly Secification 
v3.20 is supported on NetWare v3.11 and NetWare SFT III v3.11.  Also, most
LAN drivers written to the LAN Driver ODI Assembly Specification v3.20 
should work with the LAN Driver ODI Assembly Specification v3.30 support
modules.  However, you may experience problems with some LAN drivers 
written to the 3.20 specification running with support modules written to
the 3.30 specification.  In this case, the support modules in the 32SPEC
directory structure may be used on NetWare 3.12 and NetWare 4.10.

Installation Instructions:

The files contained in the 32SPEC directory structure are primarily intended 
for NetWare v3.11, and NetWare SFT III v3.11.  This is because the v3.20 ODI 
Assembly Specification is the latest ODI Assembly Specification that NetWare 
v3.11 and SFT III v3.11 will support.  The files in the 32SPEC directory 
structure can also be use on NetWare v3.12, and NetWare v4.10 (including 
SFT III v4.10).  There is a new v3.30 ODI Assembly Specification that can be 
used on NetWare v3.12 and NetWare v4.10.  However, if you are using a LAN 
driver that will not work with the v3.30 ODI Assembly Specification but 
still need to use that LAN driver on NetWare v3.12 or 4.10, you can use the
support modules in the 32SPEC directory structure.  

Rename any LAN drivers and support modules that will be replaced by the 
files in the 32SPEC directory structure.  Copy the new LAN drivers and 
support modules in the same area where the LAN driver files reside on the 
file server.

 NOTE: For 3.1x versions of NetWare use MSM31X.NLM and not MSM.NLM.  For 4.10
versions of NetWare use MSM.NLM and not MSM31X.NLM.

 Configuration files (*.ADF and *.CFG) that are necessary to configure some of
the hardware LAN adapters are contained in the CONFIG subdirectory.

 The following files are necessary for NetWare v3.11 when using the files in
the 32SPEC directory structure:

      MONITOR.NLM v1.75 or higher.
      (Currently v1.76 is contained in MON176.EXE.  If MONITOR.NLM that shipped
with NetWare v3.11 is used the file server will ABEND when viewing LAN driver
statistics.)
     
      LSLENH.NLM contained in the 32SPEC\31X\311 directory along with the 
patch manager PATHCHMAN.NLM.
      (This patch adds LSL enhancements to NetWare v3.11 and must be loaded
prior to loading MSM31X.NLM.  MSM31X.NLM will not load on NetWare v3.11 unless
LSLENH.NLM is loaded first.)

      When using TOKENDMA.LAN on NetWare v3.11 the files contained  in
XLD386.EXE are necessary.  See TOKENDMA.DOC for more details.

 The following files are necessary for NetWare SFT III v3.11 when using the
files in the 32SPEC directory structure:

      LSLENH3.NLM contained in SFTPT1.EXE.
      (This patch adds LSL enhancements to NetWare SFT III v3.11 and must be
loaded prior to loading the files in MSM31X.NLM.  MSM31X.NLM will not load on
NetWare SFT III v3.11 unless LSLENH3.NLM is loaded first.)

      When using NE2000.LAN on NetWare SFT III v3.11 IOSHIM.NLM (Also contained
in SFTPT1.EXE) must be loaded prior to loading LSLENH3.NLM.
