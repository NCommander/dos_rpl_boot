Introducing RPL.com

RPL.com is a DOS Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) Module that acts
as a Protocol Stack and responds to the IBM architected Remote
Program Load (RPL) frames as defined in the "IBM Remote Program
Load User's Guide".  It is used in networks that have diskless
workstations installed with the RPL BIOS Module.  Currently, this
is supported on the following network adapters:

     IBM Ethernet Adapters
     IBM PC Network Adapters
     IBM Token-Ring Network Adapters

Specifically, RPL.com will respond to the following frames:

     FIND                RPL.com will respond with a FOUND frame.
     SEND.FILE.REQUEST   RPL.com will respond with a
                         FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frame.

RPL.com is a Terminate Stay Resident program to be loaded at Novell 
DOS Clients that are also to function as "RPL Servers".  A Novell 
ODI driver, configured for the IEEE 802.2 Frame type, must be loaded
at the Novell DOS Client "RPL Server" before RPL.com will operate 
properly.    

In addition, the BOOTNCP.com program must be loaded on the "RPL Server"
in order for it to respond to NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) requests made
by the bootstrap programs.




Features of RPL.com

RPL.com comes with five new and improved BOOTSTRAP programs:
ETHER.rpl, F1ETH.rpl, PCN2L.rpl, RBOOT.rpl, and TOKEN.rpl. 
Together, these files offer the following features:

     BOOTCONF.sys        Wildcard characters (* and ?) are allowed
                         in specifying Node Addresses.  Also, more
                         than one Disk Image File name is allowed
                         per Node Address.  BOOTCONF.sys is parsed
                         by RPL.com at the "RPL Server" to minimize
                         Network Traffic.

     IBM LAN Support     RPL now works reliably with the IBM
                         LAN Support Program.

     RPLFIX and RPLODI   These two programs are NOT required when
                         booting a workstation with an RPL style 
                         prom installed.

     Source Routing      Booting an RPL Client across a Source Routing
                         Bridge is supported..


     PS/2 REFERENCE      The *.rpl files will communicate with the
                         BIOS on a PS/2 machine and ask it if it needs
                         to run REFERENCE.  If the BIOS says "yes" to
                         this query, RBOOT.RPL, ETHER.RPL, TOKEN.RPL,
                         F1ETH.RPL, AND PCN2L.RPL will automatically
                         present a menu on the workstation screen
                         with a "MXX.REF" boot image file name, where
                         "XX" is the PS/2 Model number returned by
                         the PS/2's BIOS.  This file name is for
                         the reference diskette image that needs to
                         be dosgened and copied into the \LOGIN
                         directory.  An example of one of these file
                         names would be:  MF8.REF where F8 is the model
                         number returned by a PS/2 Model 56LS BIOS.   





Installing RPL.com

The following BOOTSTRAP programs come with RPL.com and should be
installed in a  \LOGIN  directory on the RPL Server.

     ETHER.rpl      For IBM MCA Ethernet Adapters
                    (an SMC/WD 8003/A adapter OEM'd by IBM)
     F1ETH.rpl      For IBM Model 25SX Ethernet Adapters
                    (an ISA DLINK ethernet adapter OEM'd by IBM) 
     PCN2L.rpl      For IBM PC Network Adapters
     RBOOT.rpl      For Adapters using the Novell Enhanced Boot Proms
                    (proms engineered to the Novell Boot ROM spec.)
     TOKEN.rpl      For IBM Shared-Ram Token-Ring Network Adapters

An appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded to the workstation
in response to a SEND.FILE.REQUEST from the Boot ROM RPL Module.

RPL.com should be installed on the Hard Disk of the RPL Server.




Loading RPL.com on the RPL Server

To use RPL.com, you must have installed the RPL ROM Module on your
network adapter board in the RPL Client.  This RPL module must be
capable of sending the IBM architected RPL frame sequence.  See the
"IBM Remote Program Load User's Guide" for information on this
architecture.

Implementing the RPL function consists of creating a Disk Image
File in the \LOGIN directory of the drive where RPL.com is loaded.
A description of this process is given in the NOVELL NetWare
Version 3.11 Installation manual.

In addition,  certain IBM Micro-Channel computers, such as the new
386SLC, have a BIOS image file associated with them.  This file
comes with the computer on a diskette, and has a file extension of
.IML.  You MUST create a directory called \LOGIN\IBMLAN\DCDB\IMAGES
and install ALL .IML files in this directory.

BOOTNCP.com must be loaded at the DOS command prompt (or from a batch
file) before RPL.com is loaded as follows:

          BOOTNCP <ENTER>

BOOTNCP.com is a program written for the RPL Server that responds to
NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) frames for accessing the Net$dos.sys file
or other boot image files.


RPL.com can then be loaded from the DOS command promt or from a batch
file.  RPL.com syntax or command line parameters follow:



          RPL  [ACK] [BIND board] [BUFFERS=nn] [DEFAULT] [FRAME=ff]
               [GNS] [NOACK] [NODEFAULT] [NOGNS] [NOPROTECT] [NOTRO]
               [PROTECT] [PS=server] [TRO] [U] [UNBIND board] 
               [WAIT TIME=ssss] [?] <ENTER>


RPL.com command line parameters explained in detail:
The parameters specified by "[]" (e.g. [ACK] etc.) are OPTIONAL, 
NOT Case Sensitive, separated by blanks or commas, and may be 
entered in any order.  They are described below:

     ACK       Use this parameter if you wish to configure the RPL
               BOOT ROM Module to ACKnowledge FILE.DATA.RESPONSE
               frames sent by RPL.com.  By DEFAULT, RPL.com will
               send FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frames in a BURST mode. 
               This parameter allows pacing by the workstation, if
               the Adapter on the workstation cannot keep up with
               RPL.com.

     BIND      Use this parameter to BIND RPL to a specific
               NetWare ODI board that is configured for the IEEE
               802.2 frame type.  board may be specified by name,
               or optionally, by MLID board number (eg BIND #n),
               where n is a DECIMAL number.
                    
               If multiple boards are to be BOUND; specify the
               BIND parameter MULTIPLE times.

               If BIND is not specified on the Command Line or in
               the NET.cfg file, RPL.com will search for the FIRST
               802.2 board that is installed and use it.

     BUFFERS=nn     nn is a DECIMAL number specifying the number
                    of Receive buffers to configure.  The DEFAULT
                    is FIVE.

     DEFAULT   This parameter will OVERRIDE the NODEFAULT
               parameter if it is specified on the BIND command in
               NET.cfg.

     FRAME=ff  Use this parameter if you wish to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program to use a frame type other than
               the default to access the file server.  Valid
               responses are:

               FRAME=802.2    This is the DEFAULT.

               FRAME=EII      Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              ETHERNET_II.  This option should
                              only be used on ETHERNET networks.

               FRAME=SNAP     Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              the SNAP frame type.

               If FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP is selected, RPL.com 
               will force the BOOTSTRAP program to do a Get
               Nearest Server (GNS).

               The FRAME parameter is fully supported on BOOT ROMs
               that use the RBOOT.rpl BOOTSTRAP program.  This
               parameter is IGNORED on BOOT ROMs that use
               PCN2L.rpl and TOKEN.rpl.  However, FRAME=EII or
               FRAME=SNAP will configure ETHER.rpl to use
               ETHERNET_II instead of 802.3.  Specifying FRAME=EII
               on a Token-Ring BOOT ROM will be ignored.

     GNS       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               workstation to do a Get Nearest Server request when
               the appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded. 
               Normally, RPL.com will fill in the bootstrap
               program with the RPL Server information, so that
               it does NOT need to do a Get Nearest Server request.
	       Using this parameter MAY cause the RPL workstation 
               to find a server OTHER than the one where RPL.com 
               is located.

     NOACK     This parameter will OVERRIDE the ACK parameter if
               it is specified on the BIND command in NET.cfg.

     NODEFAULT This parameter tells RPL.com to NOT respond to a
               FIND frame UNLESS the node address of the
               workstation is found in the BOOTCONF.sys file.  It
               is provided for security reasons.  The workstation
               WILL NOT boot until the system administrator
               inserts into the BOOTCONF.sys file the node address
               and associated Disk Image File name(s) to use when
               booting the workstation.  A further description of
               BOOTCONF.sys is given under the heading of Unique
               Boot Sequences using RPL.com.

     NOGNS     This parameter will OVERRIDE the GNS parameter if
               it is specified on the BIND command in NET.cfg.

     NOPROTECT This parameter will OVERRIDE the PROTECT parameter
               if it is specified on the BIND command in NET.cfg.

     NOTRO     This parameter will OVERRIDE the TRO parameter if
               it is specified on the BIND command in NET.cfg.

     PROTECT   This parameter tells RPL.com to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program so that it will protect itself in
               the workstation memory.  It does this by adjusting
               the Memory Size variable in the BIOS data area
               (40:13) to reflect the amount of memory that it
               uses.  Using this parameter will REDUCE the amount
               of memory that the workstation has available for
               DOS by about 12k.  It is recommended that this
               parameter NOT be USED unless absolutely necessary.

     PS=server This parameter tells the BOOTSTRAP program to
               attach to a NetWare file server other than the one
               where RPL.com is loaded.  server is the name of a
               NetWare file server that contains the Image file
               for the workstation.

     TRO       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               Bootstrap Program to do a This Ring Only count of
               THREE (3) on all Broadcasts frames.  It is useful
               in a SOURCE ROUTING environment and Servers are
               available on the local ring.

     U         This parameter will UNLOAD a previously installed
               RPL.com.  All boards that are BOUND will be
               UNBOUND,  and all memory used returned to DOS.

     UNBIND    Use this parameter to UNBIND RPL from a specific
               NetWare ODI board.  board may be specified by name,
               or optionally, by MLID board number (eg UNBIND #n),
               where n is a DECIMAL number.

     WAIT TIME=ssss This parameter specifies the number of SECONDS
                    you wish the workstation to wait before
                    automatically selecting the cursored Disk
                    Image Name when multiple Disk Image Names are
                    specified in BOOTCONF.sys.  (See "BOOTCONF.sys
                    Extensions")

                    The DEFAULT for this parameter is 0000, which
                    means forever.  Any value from 0000 to 65535
                    is allowed.

     ?         This parameter will display a list of all boards
               which RPL.com is currently BOUND.




Creating and using NET.cfg

The NET.cfg file is used by various ODI modules (including the LSL,
LAN Drivers, and Protocol Stacks) to obtain the network system
configuration information at initialization time.  RPL.com reads
this file and parses it for a section describing the RPL
configuration to use.  Specifically, it searches for the following
MAIN section heading:

     PROTOCOL RPL

Note that the heading is NOT case sensitive, but the word
"PROTOCOL" MUST begin in column one (1) of the file.

After this heading is found, RPL.com looks for the following
INDENTED Keywords to configure itself:

     PROTOCOL RPL
          BIND board [ACK] [GNS] [NODEFAULT] [PS=server]
                       [PROTECT] [TRO] [WAIT TIME=ssss]
          BUFFERS nn

The parameters specified by "[]" are OPTIONAL, NOT Case Sensitive,
separated by blanks, and may be entered in any order. They are
described below:

     BUFFERS=nn     nn is a DECIMAL number specifying the number
                    of Receive buffers to configure.  The DEFAULT
                    is FIVE.  Use this parameter to optimize for
                    performance.

     BIND      Use this parameter to BIND RPL to a specific
               NetWare ODI board that is configured for the IEEE
               802.2 frame type.  board may be specified by name,
               or optionally, by MLID board number (eg BIND #n),
               where n is a DECIMAL number specifying the board to
               BIND.
                    
               If multiple boards are to be BOUND; specify the
               BIND parameter MULTIPLE times, each on a DIFFERENT
               line in NET.cfg.

               If BIND is not specified on the Command Line or in
               the NET.cfg file, RPL.com will search for the FIRST
               802.2 board that is installed and use it.

               The parameters specified with the BIND command are
               OPTIONAL and are described below:

          ACK       Use this parameter if you wish to configure
                    the RPL BOOT ROM Module to ACKnowledge
                    FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frames sent by RPL.com.  By
                    DEFAULT, RPL.com will send FILE.DATA.RESPONSE
                    frames in a BURST mode.  This parameter allows
                    pacing by the workstation, if the Adapter on
                    the workstation cannot keep up with RPL.com.

          FRAME=ff  Use this parameter if you wish to configure
                    the BOOTSTRAP program to use a frame type
                    other than the default to access the file
                    server.  Valid responses are:

                    FRAME=802.2    This is the DEFAULT.

                    FRAME=EII      Configure the BOOTSTRAP program
                                   for ETHERNET_II.  This option
                                   should only be used on ETHERNET
                                   networks.

                    FRAME=SNAP     Configure the BOOTSTRAP program
                                   for SNAP.

                    If FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP is selected,
                    RPL.com  will force the BOOTSTRAP program to
                    do a Get Nearest Server (GNS).

                    The FRAME parameter is fully supported on BOOT
                    ROMs that use the RBOOT.rpl BOOTSTRAP program. 
                    This parameter is IGNORED on BOOT ROMs that
                    use PCN2L.rpl and TOKEN.rpl.  However,
                    FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP will configure
                    ETHER.rpl to use ETHERNET_II instead of 802.3. 
                    Specifying FRAME=EII on a Token-Ring BOOT ROM
                    will be ignored.

          GNS       This parameter specifies that you wish the
                    workstation to do a Get Nearest Server request
                    when the appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets
                    downloaded.  Normally, RPL.com will fill in
                    the bootstrap program with the RPL Server
                    information, so that it does NOT need to do 
                    a Get Nearest Server request.  Using this
                    parameter MAY cause the workstation to find a
                    server OTHER than the one where RPL.com
                    is located.

          NODEFAULT This parameter tells RPL.com to NOT respond to
                    a FIND frame UNLESS the node address of the
                    workstation is found in the BOOTCONF.sys file. 
                    It is provided for security reasons.  The
                    workstation WILL NOT boot until the system
                    administrator inserts into the BOOTCONF.sys
                    file the node address and associated Disk
                    Image File name(s) to use when booting the
                    workstation.  A further description of
                    BOOTCONF.sys is given under the heading of
                    Unique Boot Sequences using RPL.com.

          PROTECT   This parameter tells RPL.com to configure the
                    BOOTSTRAP program so that it will protect
                    itself in the workstation memory.  It does
                    this by adjusting the Memory Size variable in
                    the BIOS data area (40:13) to reflect the
                    amount of memory that it uses.  Using this
                    parameter will REDUCE the amount of memory
                    that the workstation has available for DOS by
                    about 12k.  It is recommended that this
                    parameter NOT be USED unless absolutely
                    necessary.

          PS=server This parameter tells the BOOTSTRAP program to
                    attach to a NetWare file server other than the
                    one where RPL.com is loaded.  server is the
                    name of a NetWare file server that contains
                    the Image file for the workstation.

          TRO       This parameter specifies that you wish the
                    Bootstrap Program to do a This Ring Only count
                    of THREE (3) on all Broadcasts frames.  It is
                    useful in a SOURCE ROUTING environment and
                    Servers are available on the local ring.

          WAIT TIME=ssss This parameter specifies the number of
                         SECONDS you wish the workstation to wait
                         before automatically selecting the
                         cursored Disk Image Name when multiple
                         Disk Image Names are specified in
                         BOOTCONF.sys.  (See "BOOTCONF.sys
                         Extensions")

                         The DEFAULT for this parameter is 0000,
                         which means forever.  Any value from 0000
                         to 65535 is allowed.




Unique Boot Sequences using RPL.com

BOOTCONF.sys is an ASCII text file that allows you to specify a
unique Disk Image File for each workstation that needs access to
different files.  You create BOOTCONF.sys using your favorite DOS
ASCII text editor.  The process of creating unique Disk Image 
Files is described in detail in the NOVELL NetWare Version 3.11 
Installation manual.




BOOTCONF.sys Extensions

When RPL.com loads it will search the \LOGIN directory of the
current drive for a BOOTCONF.sys file.  If it finds it, it will
read it into a memory buffer so that it can parse it when a FIND
frame is received from a workstation.  Note that the parsing of
BOOTCONF.sys is done by RPL.com and NOT the BOOTSTRAP program to
minimize the amount of traffic on the network during the RPL
process.  The extensions to BOOTCONF.sys are given in this section.



Using Wildcard Characters in BOOTCONF.sys

Wildcard characters (* and ?) are allowed in the line specifying
the node address of the workstation.  This will allow the system
administrator more flexibility in building the BOOTCONF.sys file. 
The rules for these wildcard characters are:

     *    Use the ASTERISK character to specify a RANGE of digits
          in the node address. For example, if the node address of
          the workstation is 10005A123456, it may be specified as
          0x*123456 in BOOTCONF.sys.  In this example, RPL.com will
          match the node address with ANY node address that ends in
          123456.

          Note that only ONE asterisk (*) may appear in the node
          address.

     ?    Use the QUESTION MARK character to specify ANY digit in
          the node address.  In the example above, the node address
          could be specified as 0x??????123456 which is equivalent
          to 0x*123456.

          You may use wildcard characters to specify a DEFAULT Disk
          Image File for all workstations on the network that do
          not have a specific Disk Image File.  You do this by
          placing the line:

                    0x* = DEFAULT.sys
          or        0x???????????? = DEFAULT.sys

          as the LAST line in BOOTCONF.sys.  Either one of these
          lines will match on ALL workstation node addresses.  The
          DEFAULT.sys (or any name you desire) Disk Image File is
          generated by DOSGEN, the same as any Disk Image File.



More than ONE Disk Image File per Node Address

Each line in BOOTCONF.sys that contains a node address may specify
more than one Disk Image File name, separated by one or more BLANK
characters.  In this case, the BOOTSTRAP program will present the
workstation user a PROMPT at boot up time to select the Disk Image
File to boot.  For example,  if a workstation's node address is
10005A123456, the line:

     0x10005a123456 = ONE.sys TWO.sys THREE.dos

     will cause the BOOTSTRAP program to present:



     Place CURSOR on DISK IMAGE file; Hit ENTER when Ready: 

          ONE.sys
          TWO.sys
          THREE.dos



     on the workstation screen.  The BOOTSTRAP program will then
     use NCP calls to open the selected Disk Image File.  If it
     does NOT exist, it will display:

          Unable to OPEN Disk Image File

     and retry the operation.

     Up to TEN Disk Image File names may be entered for each node
     address in BOOTCONF.sys.  Note that they must be separated by
     one or more BLANK characters, and they must all fit on ONE
     line.



Multiple Lines per Node Address

The ASCII COLON (:) can be used to allow for multiple lines when
specifying a particular node address in BOOTCONF.sys.  It is
provided for convenience when specifying multiple parameters on the
Node Address line.

To use this feature, place the ASCII COLON (:) at the end of the
line.  Note that it must be preceded by at LEAST one ASCII blank:

     0x10005a460025 = NET$DOS.sys FRED.sys :
               JOE.sys



BOOTCONF.sys BIND Override Parameters

When RPL.com parses BOOTCONF.sys, it allows the user to override
the BIND time parameters with parameters specific to a particular
workstation that is being booted.  By default, the parameters
entered on the Command Line when RPL.com was loaded will be merged
with the parameters that were given by the BIND keyword in NET.cfg
to apply to ALL workstations that are attached to the particular
board RPL.com is BOUND to.  The following commands are allowed
on a per NODE basis, which if used, will override ALL previous
parameters given:

     ACK       Use this parameter if you wish to configure the RPL 
               BOOT ROM Module program to ACKnowledge
               FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frames sent by RPL.com.  By
               DEFAULT, RPL.com will send FILE.DATA.RESPONSE
               frames in a BURST mode.  This parameter allows
               pacing by the workstation, if the Adapter on the
               workstation cannot keep up with RPL.com.

     FRAME=ff  Use this parameter if you wish to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program to use a frame type other than
               the default to access the file server.  Valid
               responses are:

               FRAME=802.2    This is the DEFAULT.

               FRAME=EII      Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              ETHERNET_II.  This option should
                              only be used on ETHERNET networks.

               FRAME=SNAP     Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              SNAP.

               If FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP is selected, RPL.com 
               will force the BOOTSTRAP program to do a Get
               Nearest Server (GNS).

               The FRAME parameter is fully supported on BOOT ROMs
               that use the RBOOT.rpl BOOTSTRAP program.  This
               parameter is IGNORED on BOOT ROMs that use
               PCN2L.rpl and TOKEN.rpl.  However, FRAME=EII or
               FRAME=SNAP will configure ETHER.rpl to use
               ETHERNET_II instead of 802.3.  Specifying FRAME=EII
               on a Token-Ring BOOT ROM will be ignored.


     GNS       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               workstation to do a Get Nearest Server request when
               the appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded. 
               Normally, RPL.com will fill in the bootstrap
               program with the RPL Server's information,
               so that the bootstrap program does NOT need to do a
               Get Nearest Server request.  Using this parameter 
               MAY cause the workstation to find a server OTHER 
               than the one where RPL.com is located.

     NOACK     This parameter will override the ACK parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOGNS     This parameter will override the GNS parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOPROTECT This parameter will override the PROTECT parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOTRO     This parameter will OVERRIDE the TRO parameter if
               it is specified on the BIND command in NET.cfg.

     PROTECT   This parameter tells RPL.com to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program so that it will protect itself in
               the workstation memory.  It does this by adjusting
               the Memory Size variable in the BIOS data area
               (40:13) to reflect the amount of memory that it
               uses.  Using this parameter will REDUCE the amount
               of memory that the workstation has available for
               DOS by about 12k.  It is recommended that this
               parameter NOT be USED unless absolutely necessary.

     PS=server This parameter tells the BOOTSTRAP program to
               attach to a NetWare Server other than the RPL Server
               where RPL.com is loaded.  server is the name of a
               NetWare file server that contains the Image file
               for the workstation.

     REP       string1|string2 allows you to REPlace ALL
               occurrences of string1 with string2 in the Disk
               Image File.  The '|' (ASCII 7Ch) delimiter is
               REQUIRED to delimit the string values.

               Use this parameter to DYNAMICALLY re-configure a
               Disk Image File during the RPL process.  It is
               useful for tailoring files such as AUTOEXEC.BAT or
               CONFIG.SYS to a specific workstation.

               The rules for using REP are given below:
                    
               1)   The search IS case sensitive.  The Bootstrap
                    program will search for string1 EXACTLY as it
                    is entered in BOOTCONF.sys.
               2)   ALL occurrences of string1 will be replaced
                    with string2 in the Disk Image File.
               3)   string2 MUST be equal to OR shorter than
                    string1.
               4)   If string2 is shorter than string1, the Disk
                    Image File will be padded with ASCII Blanks
                    when the substitution is made.
               5)   string2 must contain NO embedded ASCII Blanks.
                    The FIRST blank that is encountered is
                    interpreted as the end of the string.

     TRO       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               Bootstrap Program to do a This Ring Only count of
               THREE (3) on all Broadcasts frames.  It is useful
               in a SOURCE ROUTING environment and Servers are
               available on the local ring.

     WAIT TIME=ssss This parameter specifies the number of SECONDS
                    you wish the workstation to wait before
                    automatically selecting the cursored Disk
                    Image Name when multiple Disk Image Names are
                    specified in BOOTCONF.sys.  (See "BOOTCONF.sys
                    Extensions")

                    The DEFAULT for this parameter is 0000, which
                    means forever.  Any value from 0000 to 65535
                    is allowed.


RPL.com parses the Node Address line of BOOTCONF.sys looking for
these keywords.  If an entry if found, but does not match one of
the keywords, it is assumed to be a Disk Image File name. 
Therefore, you should NOT have a Disk Image File named the same as
any of these keywords.  Note that these parameters are OPTIONAL,
NOT Case Sensitive, separated by blanks, and may be entered in any
order.

An example of a BOOTCONF.sys line using these parameters is:

     0x*1234 = NET$DOS.sys gns protect rep NODE=^^^^^|NODE=67890

In this case, gns and protect will be interpreted as KEYWORDS and
not Disk Image File names. In addition, the string 'NODE=^^^^^'
will be REPLACED with 'NODE=67890' wherever it occurs in the Disk
Image File.



Changing BOOTCONF.sys

RPL.com reads BOOTCONF.sys into a memory buffer at LOAD time.  If
the user changes BOOTCONF.sys after  RPL.com is loaded, it must be
unloaded by specifying:

     RPL u

on the DOS command line.  When RPL.com is loaded again, it will
read the new copy of BOOTCONF.sys.



Memory Considerations

RPL.com will read ALL Bootstrap programs with a .RPL extension it
finds in the \LOGIN directory and caches them into memory when it
loads.  It is designed to provide multivendor support with any and
all boards that use the IBM RPL Architecture.  Each Bootstrap
program consumes anywhere from 10 to 15 Kilobytes of memory.  To
reduce the amount of RESIDENT memory RPL.com consumes, it is
suggested you load ONLY the Bootstrap programs that will actually
be used into the RPL Server's \LOGIN directory.

BOOTCONF.sys is the only other file that is cached during
initialization time.  This file is OPTIONAL, so if it is NOT needed
there is no reason to define it.  It does, however, offer some
powerful configuration options, so when and if you do define it, it
is suggested that it be made as small as possible.
