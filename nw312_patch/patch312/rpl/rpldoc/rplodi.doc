*** RPLODI.COM is recommended only for Novell IPX Remote Boot Proms
    and only when loading LSL.COM, NE2000.COM (OR OTHER MLID),
    IPXODI.COM, and NETX or VLMS from the boot image file.  Reason:
    Novell IPX Remote Boot proms are burned-in with dedicated IPX
    code and expects dedicated IPX drivers to load from NET$DOS.sys.
    Instead, when ODI drivers load from the NET$DOS.sys the boot
    prom code cannot communicate to the ODI modules as they begin
    to load and take control.  Therefore, RPLODI.com provides the
    needed code to allow the dedicated IPX boot prom code to 
    effectively communicate with the ODI drivers while they load.

*** RPLODI.COM is not recommended for Novell Enhanced Boot (RPL) Proms
    or with IBM RPL Proms even when loading ODI drivers at the client.


HOW TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF PROM YOU HAVE:

NOVELL IPX REMOTE BOOT PROM:  At initialization, the Novell IPX Remote 
Boot Prom sends an IPX protocol "GET NEAREST SERVER" frame onto the wire.
This "GET NEAREST SERVER" frame is positive identification that this
prom is a Novell IPX Remote Boot Prom.  You can now use RPLODI.com.

NOVELL ENHANCED REMOTE BOOT PROM:  At initialization, the Novell 
Enhanced Remote Boot Prom sends an 802.2 protocol "FIND" frame onto
the wire.  This "FIND" frame is positive identification that this 
prom is a Novell Enhance Remote Boot Prom that uses the "FIND-FOUND"
802.2 protocol to attach to a server and download a bootstrap file.
Do NOT use RPLODI.com with this type of prom.  RBOOT.RPL already
has the ability to deal with ODI drivers loading from boot images.

IBM RPL PROM:  At initialization the IBM RPL Prom send an 802.2 
protocol "FIND" frame onto the wire.  This "FIND" frame is positive
identification that this prom uses the "FIND-FOUND" 802.2 protocol
to attach to a server and download a bootstrap file.  Do NOT use
RPLODI.com with this IBM RPL Prom.   RPLODI.com's intelligence has
already been built into the following files: TOKEN.RPL, ETHER.RPL,
PCN2L.RPL, F1ETH.RPL, RBOOT.RPL. 

For Novell IPX Remote Boot Proms, rplodi.com is implemented as shown in the
following AUTOEXEC.BAT -- the load order is very important -- RPLODI.COM
must load immediately after LSL.COM:

AUTOEXEC.BAT
     LSL
     RPLODI
     NE2000
     IPXODI
     NETX

The above autoexec.bat must be dosgened into the NET$DOS.SYS file.
