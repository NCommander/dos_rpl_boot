RPL.nlm is a NetWare Loadable Module that acts as a Protocol
Stack and responds to the IBM architected Remote Program Load (RPL)
frames as defined in the "IBM Remote Program Load User's Guide". 
It is used in networks that have diskless workstations installed
with the RPL BIOS Module.  Currently, this is supported on the
following network adapters:

     IBM Ethernet Adapters
     IBM PC Network Adapters
     IBM Token-Ring Network Adapters



Specifically, RPL.nlm will respond to the following frames:

     FIND                RPL.nlm will respond with a FOUND frame.
     SEND.FILE.REQUEST   RPL.nlm will respond with a
                         FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frame.



RPL.nlm is intended to be a replacement for the following NetWare
v3.11 modules:

     PCN2LRPL.nlm   For networks using the IBM PC Network Adapter.
     ETHERRPL.nlm   For networks using the IBM Ethernet Adapter.
     TOKENRPL.nlm   For networks using the IBM Token-Ring Adapter.



Features and Fixes of RPL.nlm

RPL.nlm comes with five new and improved BOOTSTRAP programs:
ETHER.rpl, F1ETH.rpl, PCN2L.rpl, RBOOT.rpl, and TOKEN.rpl. 
Together, these files offer the following features and fixes:

     BOOTCONF.sys        Wildcard characters (* and ?) are allowed
                         in specifying Node Addresses.  Also, more
                         than one Disk Image File name is allowed
                         per Node Address.  BOOTCONF.sys is parsed
                         by RPL.nlm at the File Server to minimize
                         the amount of Network Traffic.

     IBM LAN Support Program  RPL now works reliably the the IBM
                              LAN Support Program.

     RPLFIX and RPLODI   These two programs are NOT required when
                         booting a workstation.

     Source Routing      You may now boot across a Source Routing
                         Bridge.


     PS/2 REFERENCE      The *.rpl files will communicate with the
                         BIOS on a PS/2 machine and ask it if it needs
                         to run REFERENCE.  If the BIOS says "yes" to
                         this query, RBOOT.RPL, ETHER.RPL, TOKEN.RPL,
                         F1ETH.RPL, AND PCN2L.RPL will automatically
                         present a menu on the workstation screen
                         with a "MXX.REF" boot image file name, where
                         "XX" is the PS/2 Model number returned by
                         the PS/2's BIOS.  This file name is for
                         the reference diskette image that needs to
                         be dosgened and copied into the \LOGIN
                         directory.  An example of one of these file
                         names would be:  MF8.REF where F8 is the model
                         number returned by a PS/2 Model 56LS BIOS.   



Installing RPL.nlm on the File Server

The following BOOTSTRAP programs come with RPL.nlm and should be
installed in the SYS:\LOGIN directory of the file server:

     ETHER.rpl      For IBM MCA Ethernet Adapters
     F1ETH.rpl      For IBM Model 25SX Ethernet Adapters
     PCN2L.rpl      For IBM PC Network Adapters
     RBOOT.rpl      For Adapters using the Novell Boot ROM Kit
     TOKEN.rpl      For IBM Token-Ring Network Adapters

An appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded to the workstation
in response to a SEND.FILE.REQUEST from the Boot ROM RPL Module.

RPL.nlm should be installed in the SYS:\SYSTEM directory of the
file server.  In addition, certain IBM Micro-Channel computers,
such as the new 386SLC, have a BIOS image file associated with
them.  This file comes with the computer on a diskette, and has a
file extension of .IML.  You MUST create a directory called
SYS:\LOGIN\IBMLAN\DCDB\IMAGES and install ALL .IML files in this
directory.



Loading RPL.nlm on the File Server

RPL.nlm is loaded the same as any NetWare NLM:

     LOAD RPL

at the file server command prompt.  There are no parameters
associated with loading RPL.nlm.




Binding RPL.nlm to the 802.2 Board

Since RPL.nlm is a Protocol Stack, it must be bound to any and all
boards that have RPL clients attached to them:

     BIND RPL to board [ACK],[FRAME=ff],[GNS],[NODEFAULT],
                          [PROTECT],[PS=server],[TRO],
                          [WAIT TIME=ssss]

where board is the name of any NetWare LAN driver that is
configured for IEEE 802.2 frame type.




RPL.nlm BIND Time Parameters

The parameters specified by [..] are OPTIONAL, NOT Case Sensitive,
separated by blanks or commas, and may be entered in any order.
They are described below:

     ACK       Use this parameter if you wish to configure the RPL
               BOOT ROM Module to ACKnowledge FILE.DATA.RESPONSE
               frames sent by RPL.nlm.  By DEFAULT, RPL.nlm will
               send FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frames in a BURST mode. 
               This parameter allows pacing by the workstation, if
               the Adapter on the workstation cannot keep up with
               RPL.nlm.

     FRAME=ff  Use this parameter if you wish to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program to use a frame type other than
               the default to access the file server.  Valid
               responses are:

               FRAME=802.2    This is the DEFAULT.

               FRAME=EII      Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              ETHERNET_II.  This option should
                              only be used on ETHERNET networks.

               FRAME=SNAP     Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              SNAP.

               If FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP is selected, RPL.nlm 
               will force the BOOTSTRAP program to do a Get
               Nearest Server (GNS).

               The FRAME parameter is fully supported on BOOT ROMs
               that use the RBOOT.rpl BOOTSTRAP program.  This
               parameter is IGNORED on BOOT ROMs that use
               PCN2L.rpl and TOKEN.rpl.  However, FRAME=EII or
               FRAME=SNAP will configure ETHER.rpl to use
               ETHERNET_II instead of 802.3.  Specifying FRAME=EII
               on a Token-Ring BOOT ROM will be ignored.

     GNS       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               workstation to do a Get Nearest Server request when
               the appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded. 
               Normally, RPL.nlm will fill in the bootstrap
               program with the file server information, so that
               it does NOT need to do a Get Nearest Server
               request.  Using this parameter MAY cause the
               workstation to find a server OTHER than the one
               where RPL.nlm is located.

     NODEFAULT This parameter tells RPL.nlm to NOT respond to a
               FIND frame UNLESS the node address of the
               workstation is found in the BOOTCONF.sys file.  It
               is provided for security reasons.  The workstation
               WILL NOT boot until the system administrator
               inserts into the BOOTCONF.sys file the node address
               and associated Disk Image File name(s) to use when
               booting the workstation.  A further description of
               BOOTCONF.sys is given under the heading of Unique
               Boot Sequences using RPL.nlm.

     PROTECT   This parameter tells RPL.nlm to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program so that it will protect itself in
               the workstation memory.  It does this by adjusting
               the Memory Size variable in the BIOS data area
               (40:13) to reflect the amount of memory that it
               uses.  Using this parameter will REDUCE the amount
               of memory that the workstation has available for
               DOS by about 12k.  It is recommended that this
               parameter NOT be USED unless absolutely necessary.

     PS=server This parameter tells the BOOTSTRAP program to
               attach to a NetWare file server other than the one
               where RPL.nlm is loaded.  server is the name of a
               NetWare file server that contains the Image file
               for the workstation.

     TRO       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               BOOTSTRAP program to do a This Ring Only count of
               THREE (3) on all Broadcasts frames.  It is useful
               in a SOURCE ROUTING environment and Servers are
               available on the local ring.

     WAIT TIME=ssss This parameter specifies the number of SECONDS
                    you wish the workstation to wait before
                    automatically selecting the cursored Disk
                    Image Name when multiple Disk Image Names are
                    specified in BOOTCONF.sys.  (See "BOOTCONF.sys
                    Extensions")

                    The DEFAULT for this parameter is 0000, which
                    means forever.  Any value from 0000 to 65535
                    is allowed.


Using RPL.nlm from a DiskLess Workstation 

To use RPL.nlm, you must have installed the RPL ROM Module on your
network adapter board in the workstation.  This module must be
capable of sending the IBM architected RPL frame sequence.  See the
"IBM Remote program Load User's Guide" for information on this
architecture.

Implementing the RPL function consists of creating a Disk Image
File in the SYS:\LOGIN directory of the file server. A description
of this process is given in the NOVELL NetWare Version 3.11
Installation manual.

At the server console you must load and bind RPL.nlm:

     LOAD RPL
     BIND RPL to board [ACK],[FRAME=ff],[GNS],[NODEFAULT],
                          [PROTECT],[PS=server],[TRO]

where board is any board that is configured for IEEE 802.2 frame
type.  When you boot the workstation, the Disk Image File you
created with DOSGEN will get executed.



Unique Boot Sequences using RPL.nlm

BOOTCONF.sys is an ASCII text file that allows you to specify a
unique Disk Image File for each workstation that needs access to
different files.  You create BOOTCONF.sys using your favorite text
editor.  The process of creating unique Disk Image Files is
described in detail in the NOVELL NetWare Version 3.11 Installation
manual.



BOOTCONF.sys Extensions

When RPL.nlm loads it will search the SYS:\LOGIN directory of the
file server for a BOOTCONF.sys file.  If it finds it, it will read
it into a memory buffer so that it can parse it when a FIND frame
is received from a workstation.  Note that the parsing of
BOOTCONF.sys is done by RPL.nlm and NOT the BOOTSTRAP program to
minimize the amount of traffic on the network during the RPL
process.  The extensions to BOOTCONF.sys are given in this section.



Using Wildcard Characters in BOOTCONF.sys

Wildcard characters (* and ?) are allowed in the line specifying
the node address of the workstation.  This will allow the system
administrator more flexibility in building the BOOTCONF.sys file. 
The rules for these wildcard characters are:

     *    Use the ASTERISK character to specify a RANGE of digits
          in the node address. For example, if the node address of
          the workstation is 10005A123456, it may be specified as
          0x*123456 in BOOTCONF.sys.  In this example, RPL.nlm will
          match the node address with ANY node address that ends in
          123456.

          Note that only ONE asterisk (*) may appear in the node
          address.

     ?    Use the QUESTION MARK character to specify ANY digit in
          the node address.  In the example above, the node address
          could be specified as 0x??????123456 which is equivalent
          to 0x*123456.

          You may use wildcard characters to specify a DEFAULT Disk
          Image File for all workstations on the network that do
          not have a specific Disk Image File.  You do this by
          placing the line:

                    0x* = DEFAULT.sys
          or        0x???????????? = DEFAULT.sys

          as the LAST line in BOOTCONF.sys.  Either one of these
          lines will match on ALL workstation node addresses.  The
          DEFAULT.sys (or any name you desire) Disk Image File is
          generated by DOSGEN, the same as any Disk Image File.



More than ONE Disk Image File per Node Address

Each line in BOOTCONF.sys that contains a node address may specify
more than one Disk Image File name, separated by one or more BLANK
characters.  In this case, the BOOTSTRAP program will present the
workstation user a PROMPT at boot up time to select the Disk Image
File to boot.  For example,  if a workstation's node address is
10005A123456, the line:

     0x10005a123456 = ONE.sys TWO.sys THREE.dos

     will cause the BOOTSTRAP program to present:



     Place CURSOR on DISK IMAGE file; Hit ENTER when Ready: 

          ONE.sys
          TWO.sys
          THREE.dos



     on the workstation screen.  The BOOTSTRAP program will then
     use NCP calls to open the selected Disk Image File.  If it
     does NOT exist, it will display:

          Unable to OPEN Disk Image File

     and retry the operation.

     Up to TEN Disk Image File names may be entered for each node
     address in BOOTCONF.sys.  Note that they must be separated by
     one or more BLANK characters, and they must all fit on ONE
     line.



Multiple Lines per Node Address

The ASCII COLON (:) can be used to allow for multiple lines when
specifying a particular node address in BOOTCONF.sys.  It is
provided for convenience when specifying multiple parameters on the
Node Address line.

To use this feature, place the ASCII COLON (:) at the end of the
line.  Note that it must be preceded by at LEAST one ASCII blank:

     0x10005A460025 = NET$DOS.sys FRED.sys :
               JOE.sysBOOTCONF.sys BIND Override Parameters

When RPL.nlm parses BOOTCONF.sys, it allows the user the override
the BIND time parameters with parameters specific to a particular
workstation that is being booted.  By default, the parameters that
were entered at BIND time apply to ALL workstations that are
attached to the particular board specified in the BIND command. 
The following commands are allowed on a per NODE basis, which, if
used, will override the BIND time parameters:


     ACK       Use this parameter if you wish to configure the RPL
               BOOT ROM Module to ACKnowledge FILE.DATA.RESPONSE
               frames sent by RPL.nlm.  By DEFAULT, RPL.nlm will
               send FILE.DATA.RESPONSE frames in a BURST mode. 
               This parameter allows pacing by the workstation, if
               the Adapter on the workstation cannot keep up with
               RPL.nlm.


     FRAME=ff  Use this parameter if you wish to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program to use a frame type other than
               the default to access the file server.  Valid
               responses are:

               FRAME=802.2    This is the DEFAULT.

               FRAME=EII      Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              ETHERNET_II.  This option should
                              only be used on ETHERNET networks.

               FRAME=SNAP     Configure the BOOTSTRAP program for
                              SNAP.

               If FRAME=EII or FRAME=SNAP is selected, RPL.nlm 
               will force the BOOTSTRAP program to do a Get
               Nearest Server (GNS).

               The FRAME parameter is fully supported on BOOT ROMs
               that use the RBOOT.rpl BOOTSTRAP program.  This
               parameter is IGNORED on BOOT ROMs that use
               PCN2L.rpl and TOKEN.rpl.  However, FRAME=EII or
               FRAME=SNAP will configure ETHER.rpl to use
               ETHERNET_II instead of 802.3.  Specifying FRAME=EII
               on a Token-Ring BOOT ROM will be ignored.


     GNS       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               workstation to do a Get Nearest Server request when
               the appropriate BOOTSTRAP program gets downloaded. 
               Normally, RPL.nlm will fill in the bootstrap
               program with the file server information, so that
               it does NOT need to do a Get Nearest Server
               request.  Using this parameter MAY cause the
               workstation to find a server OTHER than the one
               where RPL.nlm is located.

     NOACK     This parameter will override the ACK parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOGNS     This parameter will override the GNS parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOPROTECT This parameter will override the PROTECT parameter
               specified on the BIND command.

     NOTRO     This parameter will OVERRIDE the TRO parameter if
               specified on the BIND command.

     PROTECT   This parameter tells RPL.nlm to configure the
               BOOTSTRAP program so that it will protect itself in
               the workstation memory.  It does this by adjusting
               the Memory Size variable in the BIOS data area
               (40:13) to reflect the amount of memory that it
               uses.  Using this parameter will REDUCE the amount
               of memory that the workstation has available for
               DOS by about 12k.  It is recommended that this
               parameter NOT be USED unless absolutely necessary.


     PS=server This parameter tells the BOOTSTRAP program to
               attach to a NetWare file server other than the one
               where RPL.nlm is loaded.  server is the name of a
               NetWare file server that contains the Image file
               for the workstation.


     REP       string1|string2 allows you to REPlace ALL
               occurrences of string1 with string2 in the Disk
               Image File.  The '|' (ASCII 7Ch) delimiter is
               REQUIRED to delimit the string values.

               Use this parameter to DYNAMICALLY re-configure a
               Disk Image File during the RPL process.  It is
               useful for tailoring files such as AUTOEXEC.BAT or
               CONFIG.SYS to a specific workstation.

               The rules for using REP are given below:
                    
               1)   The search IS case sensitive.  The BOOTSTRAP
                    program will search for string1 EXACTLY as it
                    is entered in BOOTCONF.sys.
               2)   ALL occurrences of string1 will be replaced
                    with string2 in the Disk Image File.
               3)   string2 MUST be equal to OR shorter than
                    string1.
               4)   If string2 is shorter than string1, the Disk
                    Image File will be padded with ASCII Blanks
                    when the substitution is made.
               5)   string2 must contain NO embedded ASCII Blanks.
                    The FIRST blank that is encountered is
                    interpreted as the end of the string.


     TRO       This parameter specifies that you wish the
               BOOTSTRAP program to do a This Ring Only count of
               THREE (3) on all Broadcasts frames.  It is useful
               in a SOURCE ROUTING environment and Servers are
               available on the local ring.


     WAIT TIME=ssss This parameter specifies the number of SECONDS
                    you wish the workstation to wait before
                    automatically selecting the cursored Disk
                    Image Name when multiple Disk Image Names are
                    specified in BOOTCONF.sys.

                    The DEFAULT for this parameter is 0000, which
                    means forever.  Any value from 0000 to 65535
                    is allowed.


RPL.nlm parses the Node Address line of BOOTCONF.sys looking for
these keywords.  If an entry if found, but does not match one of
the keywords, it is assumed to be a Disk Image File name. 
Therefore, you should NOT have a Disk Image File named the same as
any of these keywords.  Note that these parameters are OPTIONAL,
NOT Case Sensitive, separated by blanks, and may be entered in any
order.

An example of a BOOTCONF.sys line using these parameters is:

     0x*1234 = NET$DOS.sys gns protect rep NODE=^^^^^|NODE=67890

In this case, gns and protect will be interpreted as KEYWORDS and
not Disk Image File names. In addition, the string 'NODE=^^^^^'
will be REPLACED with 'NODE=67890' wherever it occurs in the Disk
Image File.



Changing BOOTCONF.sys

RPL.nlm reads BOOTCONF.sys into a memory buffer at LOAD time.  If
the user changes it AFTER BOOTCONF.sys is loaded, RPL.nlm will
detect the change and re-load it automatically.  There may be a
five second delay from the time the changes are saved and the time
RPL.nlm invokes the changes.

RPL.nlm will suspend processing of frames while BOOTCONF.sys is
being loaded into memory.
