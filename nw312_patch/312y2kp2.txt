INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This update addresses year 2000 issues.


PROBLEMS RESOLVED:

LISTDIR.EXE
The date is not displayed correctly when using the /D and /T options.

LOADER.EXE
The file server could abend at the year 2000 roll over to 1/1/2000. The BIOS
clock would also be reset to the year 1980. (This patch is also contained in
the 312PTD.EXE file.)

MENU.OVL
The date is not displayed correctly after year 2000.

PAUDIT.EXE and NET_REC.DAT
The year was not properly displayed for years greater than 1999. 

PSERVER.EXE
The banner page prints the year as 19200 instead of 2000.

PSERVER.NLM
The banner page prints the year as 19200 instead of 2000.

RCONSOLE.EXE
When selecting the directory scan option, the year as indicated by the file
creation date displays as 100 instead of 00, 134 instead of 34, etc.

SBACKUP.NLM
When the system time is set to the year 2000 or higher, the year was not
displayed correctly in the session files. It was adding 28 years to the last
two digits of the year eg., 2007 as 2035. (This file requires the file
LIB312.EXE to be installed on the server.)

SESSION.EXE
The login time was displayed incorrectly for the year 2028 and beyond.


RECOMMENDED UPDATES

Documentation of NetWare 3.12 updates is provided in Technical Information
Documents (TIDs) accessible through any of the following sources:

      http://support.novell.com
      Novell's Support Connection CD
      Your Novell reseller


ISSUE: 

Testing has revealed there is no immediate danger to any data files.



Requirements:

1) Hardware must be year 2000 ready (check with your hardware vendor).

2) Install the CLIB updates.

3) All the latest patches/fixes must already installed on the server. There are
approximately 64 individual files that need to be installed. These download
files are available from the Support Connection CD and on the Internet at
http://support.novell.com/products/nw312/patches.htm



For an automated installation of these files, install the NetWare 3.2
Enhancment Pack. (This may be purchased from your local reseller.)



Make a back-up copy or rename the original files before replacing them.



The directory structure is arranged so that files in each directory will be

copied to their respective directory on a server.



For Example:

SYS\PUBLIC\RCONSOLE.EXE should be copied to a server on the SYS: volume in the
PUBLIC directory.





LOADER.EXE Instructions:



If the patch kit 312PTC.EXE has already been installed, disregard installing
LOADER.EXE.



1. Copy the LOADER.EXE and LSWAP.EXE files to the appropriate NetWare boot
directory of the server (for example, C:\SERVER.312).



2. Execute the following command at the DOS prompt while in the server boot
directory:



    Usage:  LSWAP [LoaderFilePath [ServerFilePath]]

                Default LoaderFilePath = C:\SERVER.312\LOADER.EXE

                Default ServerFilePath = C:\SERVER.312\SERVER.EXE





NOTE: These updates work with all localized versions of NetWare 3.12.
