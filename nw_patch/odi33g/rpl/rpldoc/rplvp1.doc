This RPLVP1.DOC file accompanies RPLKTx.EXE and provides instructions
for installation and usage of RPL.VP1 on NetWare v2.x servers and
external routers.  It also provides instructions on how to install
the virtual ethernet 802.2 drivers.


    RPL.VP1 - This is the Remote Program Load VAP for the NetWare V2.x OS or
External Router.  To load properly, AppleTalk Phase-II Lan drivers  must be
linked into the 2.x Server or External Router.   RPL.VP1 must be copied into
the SYS:SYSTEM directory on a server, or, for external routers, the vap may
be copied onto the same directory where ROUTER.EXE resides.  To implement
RPL.VP1, refer to the section in this document  titled:  INSTALLING RPL.VP1.


     RPCONFIG.COM -  This utility configures two parameters on RPL.VP1: (1) 
To enable RPL on lan A,B,C, or D, or any combination of these.  Default: RPL
is enabled on A,B,C, and D.  (2)  To set the name of the RPL file that is
downloaded by the RPL vap to the workstation.  This file is NOT the
NET$DOS.SYS file.  It is the Remote Program Load file (e.g. TOKEN.RPL).  The
default name is:  *.RPL.

     RPCONFIG.COM is menu driven.  Just type RPCONFIG and it will help you
along.  ("*.rpl" refers to ANY file with a .rpl extention.)

     TOKEN.RPL - This is the file that RPL.VP1 downloads to a workstation
when the RPL boot ROM requests to be loaded.  This file loads in ram with the
vap, and waits to be down-loaded to a workstation.  When a server or external
router boots, RPL.VP1 loads and creates its own RAM AREA in the server's or
external router's ram.  Then, RPL.VP1 searches for TOKEN.RPL and loads it
into this RAM AREA.  TOKEN.RPL must reside in the SYS:LOGIN directory! If
loading on a server, RPL.VP1 connects internally to this server to search for
SYS:LOGIN\TOKEN.RPL. But, if loading on an external router, RPL.VP1 connects
externally (out on the wire) to a server to find TOKEN.RPL.  In the latter
case, the first server on the wire to respond to RPL.VP1's connect request,
must have TOKEN.RPL in the SYS:LOGIN directory.  The server can EITHER be
NetWare V3.1x or V2.x and TOKENRPL.NLM or RPL.VP1 need not be loaded on
either of these servers for the external router to successfully locate and
upload TOKEN.RPL from them.

     ETHER.RPL - This file is used for IBM Ethernet Remote Program Load.  It
functions the same way respectively for IBM Ethernet RPL as TOKEN.RPL
functions for IBM Token-Ring RPL.  It must be copied into the SYS:LOGIN
directory and it is accessed by RPL.VP1 in exactly the same manner as for
TOKEN.RPL.  To implement ETHER.RPL, refer to the section in this document
titled:  INSTALLING RPL.VP1.

GENERAL EXPLANATION OF REMOTE PROGRAM LOAD --- (RPL)
***************************************************************************

                         NOVELL RPL VAP
     In order for RPL PROMs to be able to boot from various systems,
they use a "Staged Boot" idea.  That means it sends out a generic "Find"
frame, and expects whichever kind of system it is on to be able to 
interpret and respond with a "Found" frame.  Then the RPL PROM asks for 
a file to be downloaded.  This file (TOKEN.RPL, PCN2L.RPL, ETHER.RPL,
RBOOT.RPL, or F1ETH.RPL) will be the NetWare specific file that contains
bootstrap code to boot from a NOVELL network.

     In the past, the only way to get NetWare to respond to the RPL packets
was to make the driver capable of recognizing those packets, and responding
accordingly.  This was mostly because the Find Frame is sent to a multicast
address, and NetWare 286 didn't support multicast addressing.  With the
advent of AppleTalk Phase II drivers, a VAP can receive and respond to
multicast addresses, making this the preferred way of doing things.

****************************************************************************
INSTALLING RPL.VP1
****************************************************************************
      RPL.VP1 must be loaded after ROUTE.VP0, if source routing is to be
supported. It supports several .RPL download files:  TOKEN.RPL, ETHER.RPL,
PCN2L.RPL, RBOOT.RPL, and F1ETH.RPL.
     In order to work with multiple LAN drivers, or multiple .RPL files, the
RPL VAP must be configured.  This is done by running RPCONFIG.  RPCONFIG
prints out a help screen and prompts for inputs.
     When the RPL VAP comes up, it will load specified .RPL files, and
connect them with specified LAN drivers.  Then, when the VAP receives a 
"Find" and subsequent "Send File requests" from a given RPL PROM, it will
respond with the proper .RPL file. 
     Since the VAP attaches without logging in, it only has read rights in
the SYS:LOGIN subdirectory.  Therefore, THE .RPL FILES ARE EXPECTED TO BE
LOCATED IN SYS:LOGIN.
     The server that responds to the Find Frame, and downloads the .RPL 
file, is not guaranteed to be the server that the workstation will attach 
to during the RPL sequence.  This means that the BOOTCONF.SYS files, and 
DOS Boot Disk Image Files (NET$DOS.SYS, etc.) will still need to be in 
SYS:LOGIN of every server that could respond to the Get Nearest Server 
request.  Not just the server with the RPL VAP loaded.

Installing virtual Ethernet 802.2 drivers to accomodate workstations
that need to run Ethernet_802.2 frame types with the IPX Protocol.
********************************************************************

The following virtual 802.2 Ethernet drivers are included
in this RPL KIT:


A8022         LAN           152  5-12-93  3:24p 
A8022         OBJ         3,620  4-14-93 11:19a 
B8022         OBJ         3,620  4-14-93 11:19a 
C8022         OBJ         3,620  4-14-93 11:19a 
D8022         OBJ         3,620  4-14-93 11:19a 



Please refer to the instructions below to install the drivers.

 
1) Copy the *.LAN files to the NetWare v2.2 SYSTEM-1 diskette.

2) Copy the *.OBJ files to the LAN_DRV_001 diskette.

3) Regen the NET$OS.EXE or ROUTER.EXE with these new drivers. 


**********************************************

VIRTUAL DRIVERS (ETHERNET_802.2)

        
The A8022 lan drivers are virtual 802.2 drivers which may be linked into 2.2 
servers (requiring the regeneration of the operating system file NET$OS.EXE).
These virtual drivers allow both 802.3 and 802.2 frame types to exist on a 
single physical LAN.

Virtual Lan Driver Restrictions:

1. The 802.2 virtual driver will work on Netware 2.2 servers and External
   Routers.

2. Only lan drivers written that support Apple Talk phase II will function
with the virtual 802.2 driver.  If you attempt to use a driver that doesn't
support Apple Talk phase II the symptom would be similar to the following:

        FOR EXAMPLE  If Nic Card were lan A and virtual driver were lan B
               a.  INSTALL would work and you could link and configure 
                   the NET$OS.EXE correctly.
               b.  When the server tries to come up, you could see something
		   similar to garbage caracters when initializing lan B:

                   INITIALIZING LAN A.
                   INITIALIZING LAN B #**@%&$$$%@&$&#&@#&$@&@#&&@$&$(!(*
 
3.  All Ethernet_802.2 packets on Netware 2.2 will have a max packet size
of 512 bytes.  This is due to an architectural limitation, because
802.2 has an additional 3 bytes in the header that the 802.3 packet
did not.

4. 802.3 and 802.2 on the same physical LAN board represent 2 different
logical LANs.  There can only be a maximum of three physical ethernet LAN 
boards in the system if they are to both support the two frame types. 
EXAMPLES: NON DEDICATED 2.2 server with 3 NIC cards would be configured as 
follows LAN A - NE2             NET = 1
        LAN B - NE2             NET = 2
        LAN C - NE2             NET = 3
        LAN D - Virtual Driver. NET = 4
        LAN E - NON-DEDICATED   NET = 5

Booting the server would show.
      INITIALIZING LAN A     (LAN A NET=1 ETHERNET_802.3
      INITIALIZING LAN B     (LAN B NET=2 ETHERNET_802.3
      INITIALIZING LAN C     (LAN C NET=3 ETHERNET_802.3
      INITIALIZING LAN D     (LAN D NET=4 ETHERNET_802.2 on LAN A
      INITIALIZING LAN E     (LAN E NET=5 (Non-dedicated w/s)
      INITIALIZING LAN F     (LAN F NET=4 ETHERNET_802.2 on LAN B
      INTITALIZING LAN G     (LAN G NET=4 ETHERNET_802.2 on LAN C.

     NOTE:  Dconfig must then be run on lans F and G to assign IPX
     Network Addresses for the Ethernet_802.2 frame type.  For example,
     LAN F NET=4 should be changed to NET=6
     LAN G NET=4 should be changed to NET=7
     Any other file servers running Ethernet_802.2 frames on LAN D, 
     LAN F, or LAN G must have identical IPX network numbers.  For
     Example:
     All servers on LAN D must have NET=4 for Ethernet_802.2 frames
     All servers on LAN F must have NET=6 for Ethernet_802.2 frames
     All servers on LAN G must have NET=7 for Ethernet_802.2 frames
 
                                                  
5. You must use the new DCONFIG.EXE contained herein to change the 
net addresses for FRAME ETHERNET_802.2 for LANS F and G.

NOTE: The Macintosh Apple Talk phase II VAPs for NetWare v2.15 & v2.2 
products can coexist with the 802.2 virtual driver.
        
To implement the 802.2 virtual lan drivers do the following steps:

1. Run INSTALL.EXE for a v2.2 Server or ROUTEGEN.EXE for a v2.2 Router. 
2. Select the Ethernet Lan driver for the Ethernet Lan adapter being 
   used (this will be assigned to LAN A).
4. Next, select lan drivers for any other physical boards.
3. Now select the Virtual 802.2 Lan driver as the Last lan adapter in 
   the system (this will assign the virtual lan driver to the Ethernet
   adapters which will be the next logical lan letter.

Note:  If you have two cards in the server that need to support 802.2 frames
       select the second physical Lan adapter as the second card (assigned 
       LAN B in the system), and then select the 8022 VIRTUAL drivers as the 
       third Lan adapter (it will be assigned LAN C and LAN F respectively).
