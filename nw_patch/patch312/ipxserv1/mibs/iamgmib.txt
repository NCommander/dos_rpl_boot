IAMG DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

-- This MIB defines the management information for the IPX
-- Address Mapping Gateway (IAMG).
--
-- The MIB is divided into five groups:
--
--   1. System:      Contains general information about the
--                   configuration and functioning of the
--                   IPX Address Mapping Gateway.
--
--   2. Circuit:     Indicates whether the IAMG is enabled
--                   for each circuit.
--
--   3. Mappings:    Lists the active mappings.
--
--   4. Nonmappable: Lists the networks excluded from mapping.
--
--   5. Gateways:    Lists other IPX Address Mapping Gateways
--                   that map to the same network.
--
-- This MIB is linked to the IPX and NLSP MIBs via the system 
-- instance identifier that is the primary index of each table.
