ABSTRACT:

IPX660 contains the latest common IPXRTR stack (version 6.60) for NetWare
3.11/3.12/4.1/4.11 platforms. It supercedes IPXRT4.EXE, 41RTR4.EXE, IPX65G.EXE. 
Reuploaded for minor readme change.

  It provides several fixes to IPXRTR.NLM and related NLMs. For 3.11 & 3.12
servers that do not have IPXRT3.EXE or IPXRT4.EXE installed, it enhances the
native IPX routing cabilities and provides NLSP functionality by installing
IPXRTR.NLM and related NLMs.

SYMPTOM:


 FIXES carried over from IPX65B.EXE:

  1.  Clients dialing into NetWare Connect servers could not connect, after
 installing Support Pack 3 or IPX65A.EXE. (IPXCP negotiation issues were
fixed.)


  FIXES carried over from IPX65A.EXE:

  1.  Server abends reported in IPXRTR.NLM.
  2.  If an attempt to load IPXRTR.NLM in the MS engine of a 4.1x SFT III
  server is done, IPXRTR.NLM will not load, and a message will be reported.
  (It still loads in the I/O engines.)
  3.  Improved IPXRTR error messages on the server console.
  4.  Workstation performing a remote boot was unable to connect to a server.
  when load balancing turned on.
  5.  Server with IPXRTR.NLM loaded was not able to ping the internal IPX
  net number and a node address of all FFs.
  6.  The new SET command, SET REQUIRED NETWORK FOR SERVICES
  = OFF, would allow the server to "absorb" a specific service (SAP) if the
  specific network number did not exist, but the IPX default route existed.
  However, if the specific network number AND the IPX default route existed,
  then the software had a bug where it would NOT "absorb" the service.
  7.  Server with IPXRTR.NLM loaded was not abiding by the "split horizon" rule
 completely.
  8. See PREVFIX.TXT for a list of fixes and features that were included in
  IPXRT4 and 41RTR4.EXE.





SOLUTION: 

All the listed symptoms are fixed by IPX660.EXE.

 Tips

   A. If you want to use Load Balancing, between clients and a local
  server, read 4BALANCE.TXT for 4.1 servers, 4BAL_SFT.TXT for 4.1
  SFT III servers, or 3BALANCE.TXT for 3.12 servers.

  B. If you will be using TCP/IP, download, and apply  the latest TCPIP patch.

  If the following undefined symbols occur when loading IPXCON.NLM,
  NetCfgMakeConfigPath, then install the latest TCPIP patch.

  C. Refer to the NetWare for Macintosh 4.10 for Appletalk updates.

  D. If you will be using INETCFG or IPXRTR on an 4.x SFT III server:
           a. INETCFG requires a CLIB dated March 95, or later.
           b. refer to TID 1007934
  Note: To run IPXRTR on NW4.10 environment system must include all OS
  patches including CHKLANFX.NLM.

  E.  Refer to the file TRBSHT.TXT for tips on examining and
  troubleshooting your NLSP network.

  F.  PRODUCT INTEROPERABILITY

  Every effort has been made to identify Novell and third-party products
  that require RIP or SAP to operate.  Other Novell or third-party products
  that have not yet been identified might also require RIP or SAP.  If you have
  a product that loses connectivity through a Novell NLSP server, complete the
  following steps:
  1. Unload IPXRTRNM and IPXRTR by entering the following commands at
  the server prompt:
      UNLOAD IPXRTRNM <Enter>
      UNLOAD IPXRTR <Enter>
  2. Reload IPXRTR and IPXRTRNM by entering the following commands at
  the server prompt:
      LOAD IPXRTR routing=RIPSAP <Enter>
      LOAD IPXRTRNM <Enter>

  This returns the IPX router to RIP/SAP-only mode.
  If connectivity returns, the server requires RIP or SAP to function.

  G. SERVMAN configurations for IPX RIP/SAP and SAP filtering do not take
  effect with FIPX65C.

  H. IPXRTR.NLM will not load if IRWASM.NLM is already loaded.  If you
  want to run IPXRTR.NLM on the same system as NetWare SNA Links 1.0 software,
  ensure that the LOAD IPXRTR command line precedes the LOAD IRWASM
  command line in your AUTOEXEC.NCF file.

  I. Old style QMS printers do not interoperate on NLSP only networks.  They
  require RIP and SAP for the NetWare servers on which the print queues
  reside.  For further information, read QMS.TXT.
 J. 1.  NetWare 3.12 and 3.11 servers do not have a
  SYS:ETC\NLSP.CFG file installed, by default.  The LSP Size can be
  increased/decreased in this file.  With IPXRTR v6.60, when a NLSP.CFG
  file does not exist, the LSP Size default is 1024.   (In versions
  prior to IPXRTR v6.5, the LSP Size default was 512.)

Installation Instructions:

  Warning: Do NOT install IPX660 on a server or router running
  NetWare MultiProtocol Router 2.x,
  MPR Plus 2.x,
  NetWare WAN Links 2.0, or a
  NetWare 3 SFT III server.

  To install IPX660 on a local server, complete these steps:

  1. If your server is running NetWare 3.11 or 3.12, then install LIBUPB.EXE.
  (Abends may occur if this update is not applied.)

  2.  If your server is running MPR 3.0, then copy the PPPTSM.NLM from the
  SUPP directory.    It is version 3.02, dated Sept 18, 1996. 

  3. Backup the files on your server that are included in this update.
  They are listed below.

  4. Explode the file IPX660 into an empty directory on the server.
  (To explode the file, type IPX660.EXE <Enter>.)

  NOTE:  If floppies are created for this install, then copy the files
  in the directory IPXSERV1 onto one floppy and label it IPXSERV1 with the DOS
 label command. Copy the files in the directory IPXSERV2 onto the second floppy
  and label the second floppy IPXSERV2 and copy the files in the directory
  IPXSERV3 onto the third floppy and label it IPXSERV3.

  5. At the server console prompt, type LOAD INSTALL <Enter>.

  6. Select Product Options, then press <Enter>.
 
  7. Select Install a product not listed, then press <Enter>. This software
cannot be installed remotely.

  8. Point INSTALL to the path containing the IPXSERV1 directory.
  For example, SYS:\IPX660\IPXSERV1 

  If you are installing from floppy, then the floppies must be labeled
  IPXSERV1, IPXSERV2 and IPXSERV3 (with the DOS label command) correspondingly;
  otherwise, the install will continue to ask you to insert the disk.


  After the installation completes, when you select
  View/Configure/Remove installed products, the following product will
  be listed:
  IPXRTR    V6.60    IPX Upgrade for NetWare Servers

  9. Before restarting the server, perform the steps in 31XCONFG.TXT
  to configure IPXRTR on a 3.11 or 3.12 NetWare server.

  NOTE:  IPXRTR configuration on a NetWare 4.1 and 4.11 is done in INETCFG
  when you configure and bind IPX.
