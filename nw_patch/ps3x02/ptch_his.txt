Patch History:

PSERVER.VAP:

   PSERVER.VAP    NetWare 286 v2.15c and above
   02-11-91  64130  1.21
   1)     This VAP shipped with NetWare 2.2 and 3.11.

   07-10-91  64994  1.22
   1)     This file fixes a bug that causes the rewind option to return to the
   beginning of a document, ignoring the page number specified by the user.  
   This problem occurs when in text mode.

   2)     This file addresses a problem of tabs not working properly.

   3)     This file contains the auto load feature that allows an unattended
   load of the PSERVER.VAP.  This auto-load feature will ONLY be available on 
   a NetWare 2.2 File Server.

   02-27-92  65202  1.22r
   1)     Upon loading PSERVER.VAP, the DTR and RTS lines are set high and
   maintained high the entire time the VAP is loaded.

   06-15-92  65218  1.26
   1)     Version 122.r was revised to 1.26 and passed testing.


PSERVER.NLM:

   PSERVER.NLM    NetWare 3.1x
   02-11-91  51208  1.21
   1)     This NLM shipped with NetWare 3.11.

   07-10-91  50358  1.22
   1)     This file fixed a problem when printing large graphics documents
   with serial and parallel printers.  This problem is created by a special
   condition that causes the pointer to override the print buffer.  As a
   result, garbage characters are printed in the middle of a document.  After
   the block of bad data is printed, the printer resumes printing the document
   as it should.

   2)     This file addresses a problem of the rewind function not working
   correctly when in text mode.

   03-03-92  51302  1.22r
   1)     This file causes DTR and RTS on the serial port to stay high after
   the Print Server comes up.

   2)     This file fixes a problem that causes print job corruption in the
   form of ASCII characters or form feeds.  This corruption is known to occur
   on PaintJet printers but may occur on others as well.

   3)     This file allows the user to specify how often the print server
   services jobs.  Currently, the polling time default is every 15 seconds.
   The poll time can now be set by a load-time parameter using the following
   syntax:

     : LOAD PSERVER <PRINT SERVER NAME> POLL=xx

   where xx (1 - 30) equals the number of seconds the queue waits before
   checking for jobs to be serviced.  If the POLL parameter is not entered,
   the default value is used.  If an invalid POLL value or if incorrect
   syntax is entered, the user is given the correct syntax and the range of
   correct values and the user is then prompted to press any key to continue.

   08-12-92  51866  1.27
   1)     Version 1.22r was revised to 1.27 and passed testing.

   08-11-93  52566  3.76
   1)     This file fixed an anomaly that caused the RPRINTER status to show
   RPRINTER was servicing a job, when in fact, the RPRINTER was not servicing
   the print job.

   2)     When using a Hewlett Packard Token Ring JetDirect card with upgraded
   firmware the printer would never attach to the print server.  Hewlett
   Packard did a reset while their card was in a connecting state so the
   printer would never attach to the print server.

   05-26-94  52547  3.76
   1)     Large print jobs remain in the queue after they have printed.  The
   queue may then become unusable.  The file server may run out of disk space. 
   The total size of the print job is approximately 33 MB or larger (actual
   print job size x number of copies specified).  The size of the fields used
   to process the print jobs limited the print job size to 33 MB.

   05-30-95  52662  3.76  PTF 950523  
   1)     The print server shows that a job is printing but the Rprinter
   status shows waiting for job.  This is an SPX error return code problem.
   2)     An Rprinter connection that is reporting problems may be attributed
   to the wrong connection and cause that connection to go to a not connected
   status.

PSERVER.EXE

   PSERVER.EXE    NetWare 286 v2.15c and above
   02-11-91  107928  1.21
   1)     This file is the .EXE file that shipped with NetWare 2.2 and 3.11.

   07-10-91  108184  1.22
   1)     This file fixes a possible data corruption problem when printing
   large graphics documents with serial and parallel printers.  Although this
   bug has not been seen with the PSERVER.EXE, it has been known to occur with
   PSERVER.NLM.  This problem is created by a special condition which causes
   the pointer to override the print buffer.  As a result, garbage characters
   are printed in the middle of a document.  After the block of bad data is
   printed, the printer resumes printing the document as it should.

   2)     This file addresses a problem of the rewind function not working
   correctly when in text mode.  It was also found that tabs were not working
   correctly in the previous release.

   03-02-93  108294  1.22r
   1)     This file causes DTR and RTS on the serial port to stay high after
   the Print Server is installed.

   2)     This file also fixes a problem that causes print job corruption in
   the form of ASCII characters or form feeds.  This corruption is known to
   occur on PaintJet printers but may occur on others as well.

   10-29-92  109116  1.36
   1)     This file contains NCP Packet Signing.

   05-21-93   109650  Version Number: 3.75
   1)     This file fixed a problem where remote printers when detecting a
   port already in use were not disconnecting from the print server.  They
   remained in a "Waiting for Job" state.

   02-11-94   109714   Version Number: 3.77
   1)     This file fixed a problem with the Hewlett Packard Token Ring
   Jetdirect card that was recently updated by H.P.  With HP's upgraded
   firmware they did a reset while their card was in a connecting state so
   the printer would never attach to the print server.


RPRINTER.EXE:

   RPRINTER.EXE   NetWare 2.15c and above
   02-06-91  92378  1.21
   1)     This is the .EXE file that shipped with NetWare 2.2 and 3.11.

   07-01-91  58472  1.21b
   1)     This file fixes Xon/Xoff not working.

   02-18-92  59448  1.22r
   1)     This file fixes a intermittent problem when attempting to establish
   a remote connection.  Often when the attempt is made, the print server
   responds with a message indicating that it is unable to establish a remote
   connection, and that the remote printer is already in use.

   2)     If a workstation batch file continually loads and reloads RPRINTER,
   a workstation hang could occur. IPXODI.COM with a date of 02-07-92 is
   needed to solve this problem.  This problem should only occur if you are
   using ODI Shell for DOS.

   3)     This version of RPRINTER.EXE addresses a problem with RPRINTER 1.21
   that was included with Netware 2.2 and 3.11.  The problem was that if
   XON\XOFF was defined, RPRINTER would continue to utilize hardware
   handshaking. The result was that the printer buffer would overflow or the
   printer would go offline.

   4)     This version of RPRINTER.EXE also contains a fix for a bug that
   caused Rprinter to quit accepting jobs after aborting a job that was
   waiting for a form to be mounted.

   5)     This version of RPRINTER.EXE also contains a fix for a bug that
   causes lost characters or slow printing when printing documents.  This is
   known to occur with a PS/2 Model 60 or 50 when running RPRINTER 1.21.

   6)     This version causes DTR and RTS on the serial port to stay high
   after the print server comes up.

   7)     This version contains a command line parameter to set the strobe
   time as follows:

     RPRINTER <PRINT SERVER NAME> PRINTER# Tx

     where x is a number from 1 to 9.

   8)     This version contains a fix for an intermittent problem when using
   DOS 5.0.  When loading RPRINTER.EXE the workstation would hang.

   06-04-92  59756  1.26
   1)     Version 1.22r was revised to 1.26 and passed testing.

   05-04-93  64532  3.75
   1)     This version of RPRINTER incorporates a change that allows the use
   of polled mode on all Parallel and Serial ports.  When loading RPRINTER,
   use the -P command line parameter.

   2)     This version of RPRINTER allows you to unload the last installed
   RPRINTER without specifying the print server and printer number.  This is
   accomplished by using the -R command line parameter

   3)     This version of RPRINTER displays a usage screen by including the /?
   command line parameter.

   11-15-93  64532  3.75
   1)     When RPRINTER.EXE v3.75 is loaded, the form feed (or buffer)
   indicator at the attached printer lights.  This is true only for parallel
   connected printers.  Whatever character that happens to be in the parallel
   port transmit buffer is strobed into the printer's receive buffer during
   the initialization of RPRINTER.
