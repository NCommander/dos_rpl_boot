Use the following information to determine whether a QMS printer can
interoperate with NLSP:

The "classic" NetWare daughter boards listen for RIP and SAP information
and age this information to keep it current. The newer boards, known as
"CrownNet-style" boards, query the bindery of their file server to extract
the information they need. You can determine which type of board you have
in one of three ways:

A. The "classic" board supports only NetWare.  The CrownNet board supports
TCP/IP, AppleTalk and LAN Manager/LAN Server. These protocols are visible
in the keypad options.

B. When QMS printers start up, they generate a startup page.  The system
displays the communications options on that page.  The identification of
the daughter board is displayed under the Serial and Parallel options.
CrownNet boards are identified by the words "CrownNet xxx".
     
C. Some QMS printers support two optional daughter boards.  For those
printers, look for "CrownNet" under the interface information column on the
startup page.

Do not use NLSP on the IPX network segments that have "classic" daughter
boards in your printer.  These boards require RIP and SAP.
