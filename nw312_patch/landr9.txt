ISSUE: 

    LANDR9 contains Novell LAN Drivers and Support Modules written to the v3.30
ODI Assembly Specification (files in the 33SPEC subdirectory).  It also
contains a set of Novell LAN Drivers and Support Modules written to the v3.20
ODI Assembly Specification (files in the 32SPEC subdirectory).  LAN Drivers
written to the v3.30 ODI Specification will not run with the Support Modules
written to the 3.20 ODI Specification.  In general, the v3.30 Support Modules
should work with LAN Drivers written to the 3.20 ODI Specification.  However,
some LAN Drivers written to the 3.20 ODI Specification may have problems with
the support modules written to the v3.30 ODI Specification.  In those cases the
support modules written to the v3.20 Specification will need to be used.

 The LAN Drivers and support modules (NBI, MSM, and TSM) in the 33SPEC
subdirectory are written to the v3.30 Assembly Specification.  To use them you
must also use NBI.NLM (NetWare Bus Interface Module)  for NetWare v4.1 and
NBI31x.NLM for NetWare v3.12.  The v3.3 Assembly Specification supports only
Ethernet, Token-Ring, and FDDI Topologies.  The v3.3 Assembly Specification 
will not run on NetWare versions prior to NetWare v3.12 or prior to NetWare
v4.10.  For earlier versions of NetWare use the LAN Drivers and Support modules
in the 32SPEC subdirectory.  The 32SPEC subdirectory contains Novell's LAN
Drivers and support modules written to the 3.20 ODI Assembly Specification.

 Note: Only MSM31X.NLM and NBI31X.NLM (and not MSM.NLM nor NBI.NLM) are needed
for NetWare v3.12 servers (and vice versa on NetWare v4.1).  Also, NBI.NLM (for
NetWare v4.1) or NBI31X.NLM (for NetWare v3.12) should be copied to the server
startup directory (where the file SERVER.EXE exists) on servers that use
NetWare Peripheral Architecture (NWPA) disk drivers (these have a file
extension .HAM instead of .DSK) which require NBI.NLM.  Not all NWPA disk
drivers require NBI.NLM.

 The files in the 32SPEC subdirectory did not have any updates.  The following
is a list of files that were updated in the 33SPEC subdirectory:

 MSM.NLM was changed to provide improved performance on SMP servers.

 NBI.NLM and NBI31X.NLM were changed to fix a posible hang in an infinite loop
(SPD #132737).  They were also changed to enable pre-scan on NEC PC-98
machines, including the creation and maintenance of the NBIHW.CFG file (SPD
#133158).

 NE2100.LAN and NE1500t.LAN were changed to fix a problem with the driver
abending the server when two cards were used. If one card loaded and the the
other failed to load because of bad parameters (i.e. wrong port or interrupt)
it would abend the server.

 CNE2100.LAN and CNE2100.LDI were changed to add an additional range of PORT
addresses and Interrupts.

 NTR2000.LAN was changed to correct a timing problem on 486 machines. This was
causing driver failures when the driver was loaded and unloaded or when the
card was reset.

 With the 3.2 ODI specification, adapters that did not use a slot number would
list their slot as 0.  With new buss architecture slot 0 is a valid slot.  With
the 3.3 ODI specification, adapters that do not use a slot number list their
slot as -1 (0xFFFF).  Because of this, MONITOR.NLM and the console "config"
command will display these adapters as using slot 65,535.  This will not cause
any problems.

Installation Instructions:

With NetWare 4.10 LANDR9 can be installed using INSTALL.NLM as described in
INSTALL.TXT.

 To install the 3.20 Assembly ODI Spec. LAN Drivers and Support Modules, refer
to 32SPEC.DOC in the 32SPEC subdirectory.

 The 3.30 Assembly ODI Spec. LAN Drivers and Support Modules are for NetWare
versions 3.12 and 4.1x only.  To manulaly install the 3.30 spec. LAN Drivers
and Support Modules, rename the old LAN drivers and support modules.  Copy the
LAN drivers and support modules from the 33SPEC subdirectory into the same area
where the Lan Driver files reside and are loaded from on the file server.  The
support modules are auto-loaded when the LAN Driver is loaded. 

 The following NetWare 3.12 patch file must be installed on NetWare v3.12 
prior to installing LANDR9.EXE:

         312PTx.EXE   Where "x" is 8 or higher (312PT8.EXE or higher).  This
file can be obtained from the following places:  Novell's ftp server at
ftp.novell.com/pub/updates/nwos/nw312/, from the web at
http://support.novell.com/search, and on compuserve.

         (When NBI31X.NLM is loaded on NetWare v3.12 and the message "Warning:
This version of NetWare does not support protectedmode BIOS accesses.  Without
a loader patch some PCI drivers may fail." is displayed, the loader in
312PTx.EXE needs to be applied.)

 The following NetWare 4.10 patch files must be installed on NetWare v4.1 file
servers prior to installing LANDR9.EXE:

         410PTx.EXE   Where "x" is 6 or higher (410PT6.EXE or higher).  This
file can be obtained from the following places:  Novell's ftp server at
ftp.novell.com/pub/updates/nwos/nw410/, from the web at
http://support.novell.com/search, and on compuserve.
