ISSUE: 

   These name space modules resolve an issue which can result in a NetWare 3.1x
server ABEND LockDirectoryEntry called with entry already locked. They also
include several other fixes, see the end of the installation instructions for a
complete listing of changes. 
    Because of significant changes in how directory entry information is
created/handled by the NetWare file system with these updated modules. Novell
Technical Support recommends that the affected volumes be backed up, recreated,
add the new name spaces, and then restore the data to the recreated volumes. 
If this procedure is not followed you may see one or more of the following
errors when the volumes mount:  "Duplicate Name", "There is a problem in the
name space", "Invalid HPFS name space name....." "Invalid character". The cause
of these errors are usually related to situations were a volume has mac name
space along with os2 and/or nfs name space added. On these volumes there is
likely a directory or file name that is longer than 31 characters in length, 
see #1 of the mac.nam changes.

Installation Instructions:

1) Backup all volumes, verify the backup.

 2) Update the following files in the SYS:SYSTEM directory:
   MAC.NAM
   OS2.NAM

 3) Update the following files in the server's DOS boot directory:
   MAC.NAM
   OS2.NAM
 This can be done either by using the "Transfer Files" option in Rconsole, or
by downing the server and copying the files.

 4) At this point it is possible, although not recommended, to avoid
re-creating the volumes. This can be done by restarting the server to load the
new name spaces and trying to mount the volumes.  If the volumes will not
mount, then load and run VREPAIR, with the inclosed v_mac.nlm, on all volumes
with mac name space.  If the volumes still can not be mounted it is necessary
to recreate the volumes.

 5) Delete the affected volumes.

 6) Down and restart the file server to load the new *.NAM modules.

 7) Create the volumes and add the appropriate name spaces.

 8) Restore the data to the volumes.

 _________________________________________________________

 MAC Name space for v3.12 changes:

 1)  FIXED bug where the mac name space should truncate names longer than 31
instead of 32.  The mac only supports 31 characters. (5-23-95)

 2)  FIXED where MacGenerateUniqueName was missed when doing the
MaximumMacNameLength fix. (8-29-95)


 OS/2 Name space for v3.12 changes:

 1)  FIXED a problem with handling Double byte characters when generating MAC
unique names. (1-20-94)

 2)  FIXED When the OS2.NAM module is loaded and the OS2 Namespace is added to
the SYS volume, an OS/2 Client logged in as Supervisor is able to look into the
SYS:_NetWare directory.  The supervisor users able to change / delete / copy
files from this dir. (7-29-94)

 3)  FIXED double byte. (10-4-94)

 4)  FIXED the GenerateUniqueName routine to allow spaces. (11-13-95)

 5)  FIXED the DOSValidationTable to be marked after coping it from the OS,
with the extra characters OS2 allows. (11-22-95)

 6)  FIXED When creating the japanese wide chars p-y, and then creating the
wide numbers 0-9, one will delete the number.  It is impossible to create all
20 files.  Only one or the other will exist.  There is a one to one
correlation. Wide P does not exist with wide zero, etc... (12-14-95)

 7)  FIXED Several places were allowing bad characters in the name field.
(2-7-96)

 8)  FIXED a problem in generate unique name, where we started checking for

 9)  FIXED When attempting to rename an 8 character directory name to a 7
character name in the OS2 name space when it fails. (5-22-96)

 10)  FIXED the name space to allow a ; or = to be used in a name. (6-18-96)

 11)  MAKE sure the " character is valid always (7-15-96)
